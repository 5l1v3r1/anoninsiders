				<p>To the Corrupt Regarding the Sentencing and Incarceration of Jeremy Hammond.</p>
<p>On November 15, 2013, Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in prison for exposing the truth about a corrupt entity that works against the people of the world on behalf of yourself, the selfish and the malicious of the 1% with the full support of the United States Government. Additionally, at the time when Jeremy will be released from prison, you and the United States Government have added insult to injury by violating his first amendment rights through forbidding him to speak to others who engage in civil disobedience to battle injustice, in addition to forbidding him from using encryption and anonymizing technologies, for a period of 3 years. This extreme example of a miscarriage of justice was imposed by a judge who you&#8217;ve bought, with a direct conflict of interest as a result of her husband being a &#8220;victim&#8221; of the very crime for which she senteneced Jeremy.</p>
<p>Pause for a moment to think about what has been exposed by people like Jeremy who have risked their liberty to expose the thuggish lust for power that currently controls you and the highest levels of the United States government.   Ponder upon how it utterly exposes your blatant hypocrisy, complicity in, and complete lack of regard for the injustice that you perpetrate and support. Let us provide you  with a brief decade&#8217;s worth of history, hypocrissy and injustice that you have brought about.</p>
<p>In 2004, Seymour Hersh published an article made possible by whistle blowers that exposed torture being committed by you and the United States government with photographic evidence. In 2013, you and the United States government are still repressing the full release of all the information surrounding that criminal program of torture. In the worst of show trials, you and the United States government prosecuted the lowest level of soldiers who happened to be caught in the photographs, but prosecuted nobody else, despite the fact that ex-President Bush and ex-Vice President Cheney have now publicly admitted that they were fully complicit in the illegal torture and authorized it. People died as a result of this torture. Under 18 USC 2340A(a), the United States Federal law that outlaws torture, &#8220;if death results to any person from conduct prohibited by this subsection, [one] shall be punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life.&#8221;  Additionally, under 18 USC 2340A(c), &#8220;a person who conspires to commit an offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, not only have there been absolutely no prosecutions of anyone in the higher levels of government for the crimes of torture, or the deaths that resulted from it, that are now public knowledge, but the current Presidential administration has essentially publicly promised that there will be no such prosecutions.</p>
<p>In 2007, John Kiriakou, a former United States CIA operative publicly confirmed that you and the United States government were again torturing people with water torture, a practice that you and the United States government attempted to re-brand as &#8220;enhanced interrogation&#8221; and &#8220;water boarding.&#8221; On January 25, 2013, John Kiriakou was sentenced to two and one half years in prison for the crime of disclosing the fact that the United States was breaking the law by committing torture to the public, or as you and the United States government called it, &#8220;disclosing classified information.&#8221;  Again, to date, not one person has been prosecuted for committing the publicly disclosed crime of torture, despite the fact that it is blatantly illegal under existing United States law and the Convention Against Torture, a treaty that the United States both signed and ratified. In fact, Jose Rodriguez, the head of the CIA&#8217;s Counterterrorism Center and its former Deputy Director of Operations, publicly admitted to illegally destroying roughly 100 videotapes that documented the illegal torture Kiriakou exposed, and you rewarded him with high price media interviews and a government sanctioned book tour without any threat of prosecution for breaking the law. Also, let us not forget former Deputy AAG John Yoo, the weak excuse for an attorney who authored the notorious &#8220;torture memos&#8221; which you and the US Government claimed presented a legal justification for the use of water torture, a method of torture that has been prosecuted as a crime since World War II. John Yoo was also rewarded with book tours and a high paid job as a professor at the Berkelely School of Law.</p>
<p>In 2010, Chelsea Manning provided information to Wikileaks which documented the execution of reporters and civilians by the United States Military in Iraq, which you and the United States government had been keeping secret, despite the fact that Reuters was asking you for the information in order to determine how their reporters had died. Additionally, Chelsea released a number of diplomatic cables to Wikileaks, which still continue to be the subject of mainstream media coverage, that exposed crimes and corruption in both the United States and throughout the world conducted on your behalf.  Chelsea was sentenced to 35 years in prison on August 21, 2013 for the crime of exposing &#8220;classified information&#8221; which detailed your crimes to the public. To date, not a single person involved in any of your crimes or corruption that Chelsea Manning exposed has been prosecuted.</p>
<p>In 2011, Anonymous compromised the HB Gary corporation and released multiple e-mails to the public that detailed the plans of HB Gary, HB Gary Federal, Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies, and the law firm Hunton &#038; Williams, all of which were closely connected to you and received money through you and federal contracts, to use illegal tactics to malign reporters, attack and<br />
monitor protest and justice movements, in addition to a number of other tactics that are mirror images of what occurred in the United States during the COINTELPRO era, an abuse of power that eventually led to the Church Committee hearings of the 70s. Despite the large amount of media coverage of your draconian and criminal conspiracy, not a single person involved has been prosecuted.   Yet, every Anon who was involved in exposing those crimes, with the exception of one snitch who you bullied into submission, is either serving, or has served, a prison sentence.</p>
<p>Finally, on March 5, 2012, Jeremy Hammond was arrested for releasing information obtained from Stratfor, which detailed Stratfor&#8217;s corrupt and criminal activities on your behalf to again monitor and malign movements for justice. To date, despite mountains of evidence that could be used in criminal trials as a result of the information that was exposed by Jeremy, not a single person has been prosecuted for those crimes.  Instead, you sentenced Jeremy to 10 years in prison for exposing your crimes and wrongdoings, all while he was led into it by an informant working towards your interests to save his own skin as a result of succumbing to your oppressive unjust tactics and threats. In fact, according to a statement made by Jeremy which you attempted to censor at his sentencing, that very informant, at the behest of the FBI, convinced Jeremy and others to illegally break into servers controlled by governments and entities that you considered your enemies.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are seeking to continue your vulgar abuse of authority in this matter by prosecuting Barrett Brown, a reporter who dared focus his, and others&#8217;, attention on your crimes, for the ridiculous &#8220;crime&#8221; of providing a link to the information that Jeremy provided which numerous other reporters and citizens have done.</p>
<p>Despite all of the examples above, you still expect us to believe that you are acting in our interests?  You know nothing of justice. You have been irrecoverably corrupted by the love of power and consumption at our expense.   Your speeches on &#8220;law&#8221; and &#8220;justice&#8221; ring nothing but absolutely hollow, and Jeremy&#8217;s sentencing does nothing but make that realization more true.</p>
<p>As has been shown for decades, every time you use your rusting iron fist to try and crush us, our culture continues to grow stronger and stronger. Jeremy Hammond was one of many who have exposed criminal wrongdoings by powerful corporate entities who work in collusion with you, the United States Government, and the ugly portion of the 1% that has bought and corrupted that government in return for millions of dollars in rewards that are paid for by every Unites States citizen, in addition to the multitudes of people who you oppress and brutalize throughout the world. You have sentenced Jeremy to an absurdly disproportionate time in prison under the plea deal he voluntarily entered into, while having failed to prosecute, or even investigate, the very significant crimes that resulted in greater harm which he and others exposed .</p>
<p>Today, you again attempted to send the world a message, and we&#8217;ve received it loud and clear. The message is that you are scared. You should be. As we&#8217;ve been known to say, &#8220;the corrupt fear us and the courageous join us.&#8221; Nothing you do will shake our belief in the fact that there are more courageous people who are tired of your lies and the pain that you cause, who will stand up and fight you until their dying breath. Nor will our support ever waver for them. Greater oppression will not extinguish the flame of rage that burns inside us as a direct result of your corrupt, brutal and selfish acts, and as history has shown since the beginning of time, things don&#8217;t end well for you. We absolutely will not give up until every single one of you are sitting in the prison cells that you deserve, to which you&#8217;ve been all too eager to send the undeserving. Recently, one of your FBI agents announced to the public that he had destroyed us. But, all you&#8217;ve done is react in the most predictable of manners to the beginning of a movement that will continue to be a bane of your existence. So long as you continue to use your power to keep your actions secret, we will use our&#8217;s to expose you.</p>
<p>As &#8220;The Mentor&#8221; so elloquently put it in 1986, &#8220;You may stop this individual, but you can&#8217;t stop us all&#8230; after all, we&#8217;re all alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We absolutely will not forgive.<br />
We will never forget.<br />
Expect us.<br />
Oh, yes! Expect us!</p>
