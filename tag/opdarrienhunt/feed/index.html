<p>Greetings World.<br />
We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>On March 31st 2015 Vineland City New Jersey police arrested Phillip White, and while handcuffed was brutally beaten by members of the Vineland City Police Department. Two seperate videos taken at the scene by witnesses showed no reason for Phillip to have been beaten in such a manner. Officers kicked,punched, and stomped on Phillip White until he was unconscious. The videos also show a K9 officer release a dog, and allowed the dog to bite Phillip in his face, head, and body. This is absolute grotesque behavior displayed by the police department. We know the identities of the 2 officers who initially encountered Phillip and we also have the identity of the K9 officer that let his dog attack a non combatant citizen. Our demands are simple..</p>
<ul>
<li>Release the names of the 2 officers that arrested Phillip &#038; put them on unpaid administrative leave.</li>
<li>Release the name of the K9 officer that released his K9 on Phillip and relieve him from duty pending charges.</li>
<li>Release all dash-cam footage pertaining to this investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vineland Police Department and the Cumberland County prosecutors office have 24 hours to comply to our demands, or we will release the officers names involved, including all personal information for each officer. For every hour these names are not released, we will release a name and all personal information, beginning with the Cumberland County Prosecutor, to the last member hired by the Vineland Police Department. We will also begin cyber attacks on your websites &#038; your databases until our demands<br />
are met.</p>
<p>Vineland City New Jersey police Department and the Cumberland County Prosecutors Office, the clock is ticking.</p>
