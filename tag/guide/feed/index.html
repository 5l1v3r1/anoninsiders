<h3>Off-the-Record (OTR)</h3>
<p><strong>O</strong>ff-<strong>t</strong>he-<strong>R</strong>ecord/OTR messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: No one else can read your instant messages.</li>
<li>Authentication: You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.</li>
<li>Deniability: The messages you send do <em>not</em> have digital signatures that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However, <em>during</em> a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages he sees are authentic and unmodified.</li>
<li>Perfect forward secrecy: If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is known only a secure way for information exchange, it also provides post-talk security. OTR uses a combination of different encryption algorithms inter alia AES. To have a private conversation, you need a XMPP account. <strong>E</strong>xtensible <strong>M</strong>essaging and <strong>P</strong>resence <strong>P</strong>rotocol also known as Jabber is a communication protocol that allows you to chat with others online, doesn&#8217;t matter to which provider your account belongs. You can also, increase the level of security by sending your data through the Tor Network. Visit <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/">https://otr.cypherpunks.ca</a> to download, donate or contribute to the project. For more information regarding the installation of the OTR plugin visit <a href="https://securityinabox.org/pidgin_main">https://securityinabox.org/pidgin_main</a>.</p>

<h3>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h3>
<p>PGP is a technique developed by Philip Zimmerman for encrypting messages. PGP is one of the most common ways to protect messages on the Internet because it is effective, easy to use, and free. PGP is based on the public-key method, which uses two keys &#8212; one is a public key that you disseminate to anyone from whom you want to receive a message. The other is a private key that you use to decrypt messages that you receive.<br />
Here are a few alternative programs for email encryption:</p>
