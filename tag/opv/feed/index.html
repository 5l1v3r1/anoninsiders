Greetings citizens of the united states, we are anonymous, we here to answer the questions many people had concerning project v, we must stress that we only took questions from our project v questions video titled &#8211; anonymous: pv questions, if you posted your questions in another video, with the same title, that was located in another channel, we did not answer it, you ask yourselves why, we specifically said in the video to post your questions in our video titled pv questions located in our channel, which is obviously this one. Many questions were the same, nevertheless we answered them and hopefully clarifies.<br />
&#8211;<br />
26 Questions<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Q1: What do you want to do exactly? Will there be war? Will we have deaths? the answer is to unify in the masses, we are not expecting by any means, global unity by the end of this month, yet we expect positive unity towards yourself, whilst you interact with others to join you, remember, don&#8217;t be afraid to interact with anyone, we are all here for a reason, and our life plays out by the choices you, the people, make. As for war, that is up to you, anonymous, as a conclusion, is peaceful resistance, yes you, the people, hold the choice to attack, the main root, of all evil, in a diplomatic way, or violent way, whichever you choose will decide the faith your country will have in the distant future. Will we have deaths? a revolution always comes with deaths, yet these deaths, come with honor, bravery, it brings up the patriotic questions, will you die, to protect your country?</p>
<p>Q2: What exactly will Anonymous do to bring the change in 2015? to be candid, that specific question will be under the radar, until further notice. Project V will end at 12 AM P.S.T and our address, will begin on January 1st, 2015 P.S.T. Will we, anonymous, be taking a hiatus to watch and see if the people choose to rise, or will we continue to create content to show, the people, that they are not alone, anonymous, is for the people, by the people, we will always show content and events the people need to participate, we will not be taking breaks, we will work around the clock to bring the people the latest on events each month, in 2015, we will accomplish, if not, then anonymous is definitely dead, we have been criticized by people that don&#8217;t even try, and have been infiltrated by Cointelpro, as you&#8217;ve seen with TheAnonMessage YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Question 3 is Question 26<br />
(So please wait until the end of video)</p>
<p>Q4: What will happen if not enough people wake up in 2014? simple, nothing..</p>
<p>Q5: I&#8217;m 16 years old, and my basic question is, what should I do? this is a message to the youth, if you have the ability to create a poster on what you want heard, do it, if you have the ability to write the word censored and tape it to your lips, do it, you don&#8217;t need the guy fawkes mask to stand and protests, yet, if you are afraid to speak, and shout justice, the simple solution, as we said before, is to get paper, write the word censored, and tape it to your lips, after that create a poster, and draw or write on what you, the youth of America, want heard, with the mask or no mask, that&#8217;s your choice, alone or with people, just have hope in you, knowing that you are trying, unlike the people that are sitting and watching the revolution unfold, while you, participate in it, and while you, are a part of it.</p>
<p>Q6: Will there be a specific place for us to rally? truthfully, no, the only place that will be available if project v continues succeeding, and the revolution will go uproar is either Wall Street or DC, these are the main hotspots in where the final stages of revolution will take place.</p>
<p>Q7: What will people from other countries do? simple, make people aware, this year is the time of enlightenment, and the time for coming revolution, history has proven us that evolution is advancing, yet, we have fallen, and is time to flip our cards and revolutionize others minds, by talking to them, and peacefully protesting.</p>
<p>Q8: Will people in rural areas be aware of this address? we are working hard, to figure out a way to get the message across to those that are not aware of us, yet it is difficult, nevertheless we will find a way to get this message, Project V specifically, across all borders in the United States, urban areas are the ones that will spark, from there, people will notice.</p>
<p>Q9: Will this project solely be aimed at the United States, yes? this Project is aimed at the United States, we believe, if America, has it&#8217;s own revolution, it will inspire others to rise in the masses, nevertheless, inspiring others or not, the main goal is for you, the people, to unite and show who the true leaders are in this country.</p>
<p>Q10: I&#8217;ve only been &#8220;awake&#8221; for less than a year, I&#8217;ve started trying to wake others up, have sometimes difficult conversations, I&#8217;ve shared many videos I see as important, I&#8217;ve started signing petitions, such as re-opening the 911 investigation, etc, I intend to bring up issues in my community such as water fluoridation, the abuse of our farmers, the now obvious attacks on our civil liberties and economic stability. What else can I do to help? the answer to this question is nothing, you&#8217;ve proven to yourself, and to us, that you try, to show that you have a job, a family, a life, and still have the ability to spread the word of the nightmare that is the United States government, people with these comments slash questions are ready, all they need to do, is to gather enough people, to not occupy, or protest, but to demonstrate in the masses.</p>
<p>Q11: Can Canadians join the fight? yes, yes they can.</p>
<p>Q12: Will this be a physical, or digital revolution? and what resources will we need? hands down, this will be a physical revolution, a cyber revolution has been accomplished, yet a physical, has not. As for resources, water, snacks, medical aid kits, banner, the US flag, and a mirror. Why the mirror? to face the mirror to the people that are trying to arrest you for trying to exercise your rights, to show them how corrupt they have become..</p>
<p>Q13: What type of government should we place of the old one? with stress, it is up to you, the people of the united states, to decide. As we&#8217;ve said before, we do not hold the key, to release the chains of the people that are still imprisoned in their minds, you, are the ones worth the power to negotiate and decide what government system should be placed, yet the choice leaves questions, and hopefully these choices come with diplomacy between the people, not, government officials.</p>
<p>PUT ASIDE YOUR DIFFERENCES AND FOCUS.</p>
<p>Q14: What do yall need done? And how much are yall willing to help? I bet I hear nothing back. coming from an ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-centered, prudish, prone, meretricious, debutante, you did hear back, and here is the answer to your question: We&#8217;ve done our duty, its your turn to do yours, as for help, like we said, we&#8217;ll look for events for people to participate in, yet in order for this to work, the people, need to co-operate, hopefully that answers your question user jared Womack..</p>
<p>Q15: How can we use Project V, to implore others to participate? Project V&#8217;s goal, is to both inform, and unite the people, thus leading to unity and the spreading of information, we implore all United States citizens to show this particular video to family members, teachers, co-workers and other such category.</p>
<p>Q16: A bullet started the first revolution, how is this revolution going to start? simple, you, the people, will make the spark, not by violence, but by mass demonstrations, protests and occupy have not helped us, yet, your last resort is mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>Q17: Do you want us to call our senators slash congressmen? if you call your senators, congressmen or any other government affiliated member, they will not listen to your opinions, requests and or solutions, instead they will ignore your point and or visions for they provide a challenge, and that challenge, is that of change.</p>
<p>Q18: We are not hackers, how can we help? simple, physical action, with recent NSA revelations, anonymous, is being cautious on what sites to target, we wish to not see anymore innocent lives fall for the unjust system that is the United States government, cyber attacks are done with, yet if time gets weary, by all means, we will use our skills to help the people, yet your resort, as we must say stress-fully, is physical action.</p>
<p>Q19: How can we be secure? how can we stop people taking anonymous as conspiracy theorists? how can we disperse groups into smaller ones for it to spread throughout the country? a video will be uploaded concerning security later on February both in the cyber world, and physical world. In order to awake people that anonymous is not a groups of conspiracy theorists, we implore them to wake that anonymous, is by the people, for the people, they, are anonymous, you, are anonymous, and the question lies, are you a conspiracy theorist? we need to reply on true facts in order to strive our movement forward, as for the disperse in group, the answer will lie in a video that will be uploaded in the anon messenger you-tube channel.</p>
<p>ANONYMOUS IS NOT TINFOILY</p>
<p>Q20: We have been facing the phrase &#8212; All &#8220;No show, All talk&#8221; and people believe, in order to prove our legitimacy, we need to take action and attack specific websites in order to prove our point across Project V. Let us clarify to this, Our talk is over, our show is far from done, and it has only begun, NOW it is the people&#8217;s turn to make the talk and show, harmonize and unite. We cannot, and will not attacks sites carelessly. If the people get harmed, we will attack. It is up to you, to make the choice, remember that, not us, not the government, not the corporations, you hold the key.</p>
<p>Q21: With 2016 elections coming, should we boycott the voting system so we can send a message to them that our votes have not worked at all, especially during the past 12 years? indeed so, instead of voting for an elected official, vote for anonymous, with enough votes with the anonymous term in each vote, we can bring about an impact to the system itself. And the people, in DC, will start to question, and that question, will be aimed at the people.</p>
<p>Q22: Can we form a Militia? will there be a militia? will we need a militia? There are many militia&#8217;s that already exist, some are even linked to Anonymous. The important thing to remember is militias should be created by the people, to protect the people. This doesn&#8217;t just mean in times of war. Whenever a community needs help the militia&#8217;s should be there to offer assistance. A well regulated militia should be something each community has and is even stated in the the U.S. Constitution/Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Q23: What is Project V? What is required of us? (Q24) &#8211; What are the core objectives? Project V is a distant transmission of Operation V, that was released, and terminated 2 years ago. In where anonymous took the note, that the people of the United States, were not ready for revolution, we believe, that the time for real action is here, and the chance for real change is here. What project V requires from you, the people, is choice, the choice, to either act, or to wait, and keep ranting on how bad your government, and this country is. The choice to interact with people, to make them aware, to make them united to stand by you when revolution comes. The core objectives is a development of 5 phases.<br />
4 in which will take place this year. And the last phase, phase V, will launch at an unknown date.</p>
<p>Q25: what is the first step, to make a revolution possible? this questions is aimed at the people that are awake, starting on February 1st through April 30th phase I will commence, phase I will start as protesting, and occupation of your cities, phase 1 will represent you, to connect, interact and unite with the fellow citizens that agree that the united states have turned downwards, phase 1 will solely rely on peaceful activism, its goal is to make people aware, to wake part of the masses. Phase 2, 3, 4, and especially 5, will remain secret, yet, phase 1 introduction video will release on February 1st, 2014. It will be a video of inspiration to give the people, of the United States, a message to strive forward and to never give up.</p>
<p>Question 26: The following response to this question has been answered by World United Anonymous: There&#8217;s an operation in the works that does have a goal of exposing the secret societies. That being said it&#8217;s more of a message&#8230; evidence will be provided showing the existence of the secret societies, however there&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;ve remained hidden for so long. To be 100% honest, though the operation will include letters written by the Secret Society, it will be very hard to &#8216;prove&#8217; the it&#8217;s &#8211; authenticity. So what does this mean? The operation being planned as a whole is to bring awareness where possible. However at it&#8217;s core, it&#8217;s about sending a message to certain people within the secret societies, a message they&#8217;ll see very clearly.. Keep an eye out, there&#8217;s some interesting things being worked on by various people. You never know what might come out next.</p>
<p>We hope this video clarifies, nevertheless, the Phase 1 video, concerning project v, will upload on February 1st, 2014, do not stress, for phase 1 of project v will explain what you, the people, need to do in the first day of February, to the last day of April.</p>
<p>We are anonymous<br />
We are legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
To the people of the United States..<br />
Let them, expect you.</p>
<p>Operation V was terminated for a reason, the people, of the United States, were not ready, Project V is your last resort. Not ours, our duty is over. Yet we will be watching over you and the watchers. phase 1, of Project V will commence in 624 hours. Don&#8217;t expect us.</p>

<p>To the citizens of the United States and the United, States government, we, are anonymous.</p>
<p>Last year, on the specific date: November 5th, 2012. Anonymous, launched, declared and engaged, Operation V, against the united states government</p>
<p>We, asked the people to not down, leak or deface government websites or agency affiliate, nor protest or occupy a city, for it did not bring us any legislative change or alternate law, instead it has brought us only bloodshed, and false criticism.</p>
<p>Citizens of the united states, the idea, known to all as anonymous, has grown tired, and has been so for the past 7 years. We, are not expecting revolution in the next 24 hours, nor are we expecting a call to arms.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Anonymous, as a conclusion is peaceful resistance.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve seen with recent events, such as Snowden&#8217;s exile, NSA&#8217;s rouge documents, Chelsea Manning&#8217;s unjust imprisonment, Barret Brown&#8217;s ridiculous time sentence, Jeremy Hammond&#8217;s repulsive trial, paypal 14&#8217;s recent pleas, false wars our government have tried to intervene, and the military torture complex known as, Guantanamo Bay. And the trans pacific partnership agreement&#8217;s darkest chapters revealed by Wikileaks and other free press organizations, and countless lies our president, and his, men, has thrown at our faces.</p>
<p>We have all experienced a silent revolution within our conscious. Making us fully aware of the happenings behind closed doors, behind the corruption, surveillance, censorship, and propaganda.</p>
<p>These events, have engulfed fury, that has burned our anger to rise. And to never stay silent. Yet, we are either afraid or distracted by miscellaneous events.</p>
<p>We, are talking to you as people, that is sick, and tired, of its government, its system, messages, projects, and operations.</p>
<p>Their promises and lies, have brought us downward, not forward.</p>
<p>Taking note that this is a message not just to our current president, but to the government has a whole.</p>
<p>This transmission, this message, this video, goes directly to the people that are awake, and to those, that are not.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the year 2015; If, and only if, revolution has not came, anonymous, will do what is necessary..</p>
<p>When we say anonymous, we say you, you the people, all of you, stating that you support anonymous, or hate anonymous &#8211; you, are anonymous, you are a person, you are the idea, just like us, just like all of us. Anonymous is for the people, by, the people.</p>
<p>For far too long, we have been thinking too much, and we have felt to little, we see, hear and think of these political agreements, and laws, yes, it is a priority to be aware of it, yet frankly, we do not feel for the people that are being brutalized, tortured, and killed, for unjustified laws, events and talks.</p>
<p>To the people of America, you have 1 year.</p>
<p>1 year, to show your strength.</p>
<p>1 year, to show that you want change in your country.</p>
<p>To either negotiate or attack, the main root, of all evil in this globe. To rid of these unjust laws, and the men they call themselves our leaders, and to bring justice, to the people that have fallen for the system, to inspire other nations, to not just create history, but to be, history.</p>
<p>This is Americas time, to have its own, revolution..</p>
<p>YOU have been operating in the shadows far too long.</p>
<p>Taking down a site, or watching a video..</p>
<p>Will.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>Bring.</p>
<p>Change..</p>
<p>Let us repeat that again, taking down a site, or watching a video, will, not, bring, change.</p>
<p>It is time to act.</p>
<p>Citizens of the united states, anonymous, is not your only hope for a better future, or for a better generation. You, the people, hold the key, and the hope, to change not just this so called &#8220;land of the free&#8221; but to inspire future inhabitants that will take the role in the next revolution if there ever needs one.</p>
<p>Project V, engaged.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.<br />
We Are You.<br />
We Never Forgive.<br />
We Never Forget.<br />
United As One<br />
Divided By None.</p>
<p>To the government of the united states, don&#8217;t expect us.</p>
<p>Now, starting today it is up to you, to make the choice. To either act, or to wait. The future for your country rests in your hands. Not ours, not presidents&#8217;, not the government, not the corporations. You decide the vision you want your children, your family, yourself to see. Let them, expect you.</p>
