<p>Citizens of Fullerton, we are anonymous.</p>
<p>We bring you this message to address to you, of an unjust action that has taken place very so recently.</p>
<p>On may 8th 2012, Manuel Ramos, a police officer from Fullerton, California, has been charged with second degree murder for allegedly beating a mentally-ill homeless person to death. His co-worker, Officer Jay Cicinelli, faces charges of involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. The video, in the background, from a surveillance camera shows Kelly Thomas, the victim, pleading for his life while the officers beat him to death on the street.</p>
<p>Kelly Thomas was beaten to death by six cops, four of whom never saw trial, two of whom just walked free.</p>
<p>Kelly Thomas, was never a criminal, or even less could cause harm to someone, and seeing this court of lies let these men free, send a message to the citizens of Fullerton, and to us.</p>
<p>And the message is clear, we, are not, pleased.</p>
<p>We are asking the citizens of the Fullerton to occupy every police station in its location. This will not go quiet.</p>
<p>This is a call to justice.</p>
<p>Operation Fullerton, Engaged</p>
<p>We are anonymous<br />
We are legion<br />
We never Forgive<br />
We never forget</p>
<p>To the police in Fullerton, this is not an empty threat, anonymous, will be watching all your actions, and you base.</p>
<p>You mess with the people, we will mess with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Communique From Anonymous  &#8211;  USA Day Of Vengence</p>
<p>Wednesday &#8211; September 21, 2011</p>
<p>On September 17, 2011 approximately 15,000 peaceful demonstrators in dozens of cities around the USA gathered, marched &#8211; and occupied public space to protest the unjust policies of the US government and the corruption in our financial institutions. The central protest site was in the financial district of New York City, where peaceful protesters faced phalanxes of heavily armed paramilitary police officers from local and federal jurisdictions. The arrests began almost immediately, many for violating the 1845 so called &#8220;mask&#8221; laws.</p>
<p>Later that day, and according to plan &#8211; many of these protests ended with a peaceful  occupation of public space. Again, the central occupation occurred in NYC. More arrests continued to take place. All of this was expected, it is part of progressive activism. Anonymous was content to challenge these stupid &#8220;mask&#8221; laws in court. Not only is the Guy Fawlkes mask covered under freedom expression as a symbol of our movement, but we believe that everyone has a right to protest anonymously using bandanas, masks &#8211; etc.</p>
<p>But then on Tuesday &#8211; September 20, 2011 everything changed in a flash of police instigated violence. As rain began to fall on the NYC encampment, heavily armed police moved in; Removing tarps used to cover media equipment, arresting independent journalists, confiscating media equipment &#8211; and using excessive force against and arresting innocent peaceful protesters, several of whom were abused and injured.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/dyvbI6Eq-qA">http://youtu.be/dyvbI6Eq-qA</a></p>
<p>This year, we heard President Barack Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton say over and over in country after country from the Balkans through the mid-east to Africa that the right to peacefully protest and occupy public space is a right that MUST be respected in every instance. And they are correct, and this also applies to the USA. In fact, even more so. In the USA of all countries in the world, the police should have been deployed to PROTECT the protesters &#8211; not a giant brass bull that is the ultimate symbol of greed and corruption in America. And yet we were treated to the grotesque picture of dozens of armored police surrounding this brass bull, while thousands more police were deployed solely to harass, arrest &#8211; and abuse peaceful protesters.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/qdvYAj">http://bit.ly/qdvYAj</a></p>
<p>Anonymous &amp; the other cyber liberation groups around the world together with all the freedom loving people in the USA will NOT stand for this. We will peacefully yet forcefully resist the abuses of the NYC Police Department. And so Anonymous announces a nationwide &#8220;Day Of Vengence&#8221; to take place in dozens of cities across the USA on Saturday &#8211; September 24, 2011 at High Noon.</p>

<p>Video &#8211; <a href="http://youtu.be/2svRa-VSaOU">http://youtu.be/2svRa-VSaOU</a></p>
<p>In coordination with these protests across the USA on September 24th, Anonymous and other cyber liberation groups will launch a series of cyber attacks against various targets including Wall Street, Corrupt Banking Institutions &#8211; and the NYC Police Department. We encourage the media to follow the Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/PLF2012" rel="nofollow">&commat;PLF2012</a> for ongoing reports throughout the day.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous &#8211; We Are Everywhere &#8211; We Are Legion &#8211; We Never Forget &#8211; We Never Forgive</p>
<p>EXPECT  US  &#8212;  Anonymous</p>
