<p>Serena Shim was a born and raised citizen American citizen of Lebanese orIgin. She was a reporter for Press TV in Lebanon, Iraq and the Ukraine. On October 2014, Shim was sent to Turkey on a mission to cover the ISIL conflict. During her investigations for her job Shim claimed that ISIL fighters were being transported humanitarian aid of World Food Organizations and other NGO&#8217;s en route from Turkey to Syria, adding she had footage to prove her claim. She also claimed Turkey was helping ISIL. After reporting she had a story forthcoming she was accused of by MIT in Turkey of being a spy. Days later she was involved in a suspicious accident. The United States has a duty to protect its citizens and to open an independent investigation into her death.</p>
