We are Anonymous</p>
<p>We have identified the major targets who are Taiji enablers that need to be death with &#8211; if we find more along the way &#8211; which we expect to &#8211; they will suffer a similar fate. So on with the show.</p>
<p>These 5 first groups virtually have the power to stop Taiji but instead all profit from the massacre. And in fact, WAZA &#038; IMATA are often seen at Taiji assisting in choosing dolphins for captivity. DDos is great but defacing their site and leaving a message from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpKillingBay" rel="nofollow">#OpKillingBay</a> is preferable because it becomes a tangible piece of evidence that is more damaging to them and it makes great eye candy for the media &#038; PR .  Just be careful. This is not child’s play.</p>
<p>Ultimately accessing Waza &#038; Imata servers, emails and accounts is the main goal, for it is there we can find evidence to use them against. IE. Proof they support Taiji, Pay-offs, bribes, illegal importing of dolphins, ETC.</p>

<p>AQUARIUMS<br />
There are countless aquariums who fuel the dolphin &#038; whale hunts. Hitting/defacing their sites and leaving our message is a must. But for the sheer audacity of it, hi-jacking a twitter feed especially Seaworld’s would be a PR win for us and another fucking embarrassment for Seaworld. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Citiziens of the World. We are the collective Anonymous&#8230;<br />
We are the Voice of the People&#8230;</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, you have no doubt seen and heard news regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpKillingBay" rel="nofollow">#OpKillingBay</a>. The <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Op" rel="nofollow">#Op</a> is getting attention and that is good. To be honest, we had hoped for more support but we know that other Ops are in progress and we hold true to the belief that no one Op is more important than another. And each of us at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpKillingBay" rel="nofollow">#OpKillingBay</a> individually and as a whole support other ops.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the fact that ‘Saving Dolphins’ is seen as cliché or is at the top of the list in moral fagging.<br />
So be it. Call us moral fags. Strength comes in resolve. And we’re not quitting. Have we made mistakes along the way? In hindsight, perhaps, but our intentions were and are honorable. We’re only human, albeit Anonymous humans. </p>
<p>So here is our STRATEGIC BRIEF, if you will:  A guide as much as it for us, as it is for you.<br />
As we go forward, it will be become more defined, targets may change, new targets could be added, Intel may come and go, certain groups could be responsible for specific targets. But the end goal remains clear: Expose Taiji to the world &#038; ShutTaijiDown</p>
<p>OVERVIEW:<br />
We thought breaking down <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpKillingBay" rel="nofollow">#OpKillingBay</a> would help dispel the notion that this is just about saving dolphins. It’s about corruption, (Taiji &#038; Gov officials paying off various group) (Substituting dolphin meat into canned tuna and other meats) greedy aquarium owners making money off captive dolphins and lastly, the unimaginable abuse. </p>
<p>With us so far, read on…</p>
<p>GOAL:<br />
To expose this to the media and shift the focus back onto Taiji. How? By any means necessary, be it a cyber attack, a letter, a tweet, a stunt – we need the Media to pick this up and expose it to the rest of the world – then the will of the people can take it from there. Need proof <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpKillingBay" rel="nofollow">#OpKillingBay</a> is filled with thousands of people thanking us, begging us and offering their support to expose these fuckers to the world.</p>
<p>TAIJI</p>
<p>The hunt lasts from Sept to March: 20, 000 dolphins and pilot whales are killed every year. Hundreds are sold to aquariums to endure a life of captivity – and that’s after watching their family members slaughtered: How by sticking a spike through their orifice and breaking their spines – death sometimes takes hours as they choke on their own blood. </p>
<p>Quote from activist on the ground in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Taiji" rel="nofollow">#Taiji</a><br />
“The bay turns completely red with blood. The screams of these gentle, human loving dolphins and pilot whales getting slaughtered is beyond words. The laughing of the fishermen….and then nothing but silence after the carnage. You never forget it. I’ve seen a lot of things as an animal activist. But this, this is evil. This is hell.”  </p>
<p>Graphic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgDkcXljh4c<br />
http://www.wdcs-na.org/story_details.php?select=352</p>
<p>These hunts are carried out in guise of tradition. It’s not. Make no mistake: It’s about money. Captive dolphins fetch over $100,000 dollars. Dead dolphins can sell for $6,000 for their meat. *The Jap Gov has been hiding the fact that mercury levels in dolphin meat is testing well above the norms* </p>
<p>WHO IS TO BLAME?</p>
<p>1) There are many. It starts with the Gov of Japan and the fisheries ministries who allow this to go on. We then have a group of called the (ICR) International Cetacean Research from Japan who support <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Taiji" rel="nofollow">#Taiji</a> and actually help fund the slaughters. This is followed by the local Taiji organizations and council offices.</p>
<p>2) Then there are the international groups, primarily WAZA (World Association of  Zoos &#038; Aquariums) and  IMATA (International Marine Animal Trainers Association) who support <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Taiji" rel="nofollow">#Taiji</a> under the guise of regulatory and conservationists. WAZA has the power to abolish the violent captures and out an end to Taiji but they do nothing. IMATA benefit from Taiji because they train dolphin trainers &#8211;</p>
<p>http://www.internationalwhaleprotection.org/forum/index.php?/topic/6571-seaworld-co-waza-and-imata-and-their-collaboration-with-the-dolphin-slaughter-in-japan/</p>
<p>3) Next are the airlines that ship captive dolphins in coffin sized crates with shallow, stale water. Many don’t survive the trip. Those airlines include Hong Kong Airlines, Fed-Ex, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Air China, UPS and DHL<br />
http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/10/07/establishing-dolphin-no-fly-zone-would-it-end-captures-cove </p>
<p>4) And lastly, there are the aquariums and their mega rich owners. There are literally hundreds. SeaWorld were one of the first to import cetaceans from Taiji. They started the trend. None of their cetaceans now come from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Taiji" rel="nofollow">#Taiji</a> but the bloodlines do.  Fuck’em.  *See List</p>
<p>THE LIST</p>
<p>So, knowing all of this, here is a list of targets we have compiled so far. Obviously, this may change as we go forward. We are not naïve enough to believe that a cyber attack is going to change things  &#8211; but<br />
If it gets the media’s attention, it’s a plus.  We are combining these attacks with social &#038; twitter campaigns targeting many of the enablers and also key political and Government figures can bring this issue to attention. </p>

<p>So, there you have it. We are trying to be as transparent and open as we can be in hopes of getting more willing Anons, Hacktivist &#038; Activist to help us out. This should be a global effort. United together to stop this fucking inhumane massacre and needless captivity.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t think it can be done. India just declared dolphins are now non-human persons and has banned holding them in captivity for the purposes of commercial entertainment, private or public exhibition and interaction purposes whatsoever.<br />

<p>PRESS RELEASE: Operation KillingBay has been fruitful in some, But it has also been null in other ways. The Leadership of Operation KillingBay has had some disagreements, over how the Operation should be ran. And if attacking the Japanese government or Military is the wisest course of Action. In Ops like this, <strong>IT IS THE END RESULTS THAT WILL JUSTIFY THE MEANS</strong>.</p>
<p>Anonymous and it&#8217;s Allies will continue attacking both Government and Military Websites, the private sector websites will still be Attacked(Namely SeaWorld WAZA &#038; IMATA). </p>
<p>Global Websites are not an Exception.<br />
IF YOU SUPPORT TAIJI IN ANY WAY COULD BE ATTACKED BY ANONYMOUS<br />
We do not Forgive&#8230;. As an example the Syrian Government was hacked into and a massive Username &#038; Password list was LEAKED to the public.</p>

<p><strong>FYI</strong>: You support Taiji if you&#8230;Go to SeaWorld&#8230;Go to Zoo&#8217;s&#8230;Visit Taiji as a Tourist&#8230;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Citiziens of the World.<br />
We are Anonymous<br />
Operation Killing Bay (OpKillingBay):</p>
<p>A Call to War</p>
<p>The massacre in Taiji has been going on for far too long. It’s existed on the assumption that it’s part of the traditional Taiji way of life. A lie concocted by Taiji officials. It’s about money. And, while the Japanese Government shares the blame, there are many enablers who profit and/or are complicit.</p>
<p>The gruesome deaths the dolphins &#038; whales suffer is akin to the dark ages. Shoving a metal pipe down their orifice to break their spines. Holding them in a pen,<br />
dividing them into groups: the ones not chosen for captivity slaughtered in front of other family members who go on to live a life of captivity if they survive the shock of seeing their family members massacred.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgDkcXljh4c </p>
<p>Make no mistake the Taiji is fueled by the prices that aquariums pay for dolphins and whales to be taken captive which can be $100,000.  Those who aren’t suitable for captivity are either cut up for meat or just for the hell of it.  </p>
<p>IMATA (International Marine Animal Trainers Association) and WAZA (World Association of Zoos and Aquariums) masquerade as protectors and regulators of dolphins but are shockingly guilty of doing nothing. IMATA are shady supporters of Taiji because without dolphins (and orcas) they wouldn’t exist. They also have even been seen helping at Taiji. WAZA and its Exec Dir Dr. Gerald Dick have the power to influence and stop Taiji but they do nothing. That is as good as fucking guilty.</p>
<p>SeaWorld and other aquariums are also the main culprits buying their dolphins and orcas from these hunts giving Taiji and others reason to exist. Sometimes even, importing them using loop holes in the laws and back channels.</p>
<p>Fault also lies with the airlines like Fed Ex, Japan Air &#038; others who make a tidy profit transporting dolphins and orcas in coffin sized boxed filled with rancid &#038; stale water to a life of captivity. They need to know and the public needs to know this is not fucking alright. We need to cut off the supply chain and it starts with those airlines who are complicit.</p>
<p>Exposing and breaching these groups will get media attention and put the focus back on Taiji. The public outcry from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackFish" rel="nofollow">#BlackFish</a> and the re-emergence of ‘The Cove’ will work in our favor. Now is the time to strike exposing and breaching these enablers will bring the focus back on Taiji and gain valuable media attention &#8211; putting pressure on the one entity that can shut Taiji down, The Japanese Government.</p>
<p>So far no one has been able to stop them. But they haven’t felt the Wrath of Anonymous yet. We need to stop this shit. We need to come together and let the world know this is unacceptable. The people have spoken. Anonymous has spoken.</p>

    Greeting Citiziens of the World, We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>    Over the past few days we have alongside the LulzSec_Press released several pastebins regarding Taiji Japan.<br />
    While LulzSec_Press was DDoS Japanese Government websites, We were intercepting Communication from Japan.<br />
    We specifically targeted the Japanese &#8220;Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry &#038; Fisheries&#8221;  http://www.maff.go.jp<br />
    In the Intercepted Communications We were able to gather information about a Fishery Program that both Taku Eto and Yoshita Kajiya are both well aware of.<br />
    With all the growing Competition from both Korea and Taiwan in the Tuna and fishing industry. Japan decided to do something about that. And Program DevoX was born<br />
    The Program know as &#8220;DevoX&#8221; is where Japanese exports of Tuna to the world are switched from Tuna to Dolphin Meat.<br />
    What does that mean for you and me?<br />
    It means that most of the &#8220;Tuna&#8221; in your favorite Store isn&#8217;t really Tuna at all its Dolphins meat.<br />
    Most of this Dolphins used for &#8220;DevoX&#8221; are taken from a Town in Japan known as Taiji. That right you&#8217;ve heard that name before.<br />
    Taiji is where thousands of Dolphins are slaughtered each year. Japan has been operating there &#8220;Program DevoX&#8221; for as many as Four Years.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, citizens of the world. This is a message from the Anonymous Collective.</p>
<p>We have been receiving disturbing reports of dolphin slaughter in the village of Taiji in Japan. Innocent and fun loving dolphins are being lured into traps laid out by the Taiji butchers, and are ultimately either captured and transported to marine parks worldwide, or are killed, and their flesh is sold as whale meat by companies such as Yahoo, despite several health concerns.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of this message: Government of Japan, we have been watching you and your sick actions from a very long time. Despite several pleas from the international community, you have not stopped butchering these mammals, for your personal gains. You are putting your people&#8217;s lives at risk by allowing them to consume whale meat. Not only that, you have brought great shame upon Japan by performing these acts.</p>
<p>This is our final warning, STOP these slaughters IMMEDIATELY, or get ready to face the extent of our wrath.</p>
<p>To the activists at Taiji, know that Anonymous stands with you in your every step. Keep documenting these violations, something which the main stream media will never bother to do. As for the Japanese Government, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.<br />
We Are Legion.<br />
We Do Not Forgive.<br />
We Never Forget.<br />
