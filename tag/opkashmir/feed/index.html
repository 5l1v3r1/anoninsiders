<p>Greeting’s citizens of the World,</p>
<p>We’d like to give you today&#8217;s entertainment.</p>
<p>It has come to the attention of the collective that the Indian Military has been committing multiple human rights abuses in Occupied Kashmir. These stem from arresting protestors to systematically raping villages, all in the attempt of crushing dissent and forcing obedience.  The unlawful occupation of Kashmir has been something that has been swept under the rug of international affairs. It appears that Human Rights is a term that has been tossed around for only the convenience of political parties. It appears that Human Rights don’t matter when it is a country that presents a financial interest to the United States of America. This struggle has gone on for decades irrespective of the barbaric styles of abuse employed by India, but has gone largely ignored.</p>
<p>So we come to today, while protestors in Kashmir have, yet again, taken to the streets, Anonymous has taken to the internet in support of their struggle. On February 9, the Indian government executed  Afzal Guru, in connection with 2001 Parliament attack. The question whether he was guilty or not is debatable and the majority of Kashmiris and people from civil rights groups within India and Amnesty International maintain that Afzal wasn&#8217;t given a fair trial and was hanged to death to satisfy the &#8216;collective conscience&#8217; of the Indian society. The execution sparked a series of protests in the region followed by a brutal repression at the hands of the Indian Armed Forces. Over 100 protesters have been injured and four deaths at the hands on Indian forces have been confirmed and people fear that the toll will rise. Two pregnant ladies lost their lives just because Indian troops did not allow them to be taken to a hospital. The Chief Administrator of Occupied Kashmir Omar Abdullah passed a gag order on all forms of media and later had the audacity to ask the people of Occupied Kashmir to come up with proof of the gag order, showing his hypocrisy and exposing his claim of being a representative of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>But Anonymous does not forget, and neither do the people of Kashmir. These murders will not go unnoticed, Anonymous will expose the farce of a Democracy India claims to be. We have acted in support of the protests on the ground. The people are calling for their promised plebiscite. We will continue to press for reform in the region of Occupied Kashmir. The acts of the Indian Military Machine in that region have gone on long enough.</p>
<p>The facts remain. The people of Kashmir do not feel they on any level are citizens of India. When a country puts you under siege for days till your supplies run out, shoot children as young as 8, kills people in custody, rapes &#038; murders women and brushes them under the carpet as cases of drowning, you cease to be a part of that country, you are living in a colony. Independence from India remains the only viable option to the people of Occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, we do NOT support any other claims to the region, spare the claims made by the people of Occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>In support of the protestors of Occupied Kashmir, Anonymous &#038; ZHC have taken down the following sites: Click  <a href="http://pastebin.com/qaP6KfMG">HERE</a> to read the list.</p>
<p>We have simply shown our support to the protestors of Kashmir in the best way Anonymous knows. By organizing our own virtual sit-ins. We will continue to do so, along side the people protesting on the ground. As long as feet march in the region Anonymous will bring down websites.<br />

<p>This is a call to the Anonymous to express their solidarity with the people of Occupied Kashmir, who after decades of oppression, are now being completely cut-out from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>On February 9, the Indian government executedof Afzal Guru, in connection with 2001 Parliament attack. The question whether he was guilty or not is debatable and the majority of Kashmiris and people from civil rights groups within India and Amnesty International maintain that Afzal wasn&#8217;t give a fair trail and was hanged to death to satisfy the &#8216;collective conscience&#8217; of the Indian society.</p>
<p>This demonstration of differential justice treatment for the Muslim Kashmiris ignited a wave of outrage among the population. In anticipation of this reaction, even before the Indian Home Ministry confirmed that Afzal Guru had been hanged and his family notified, a media blackout and a strict curfew was enforced in almost every part of Kashmir and the internet shutdown. The execution sparked a wave of protests in the region followed by a brutal repression. Many protesters have been injured and three deaths at the hands on Indian forces have been confired and people fear that the toll will rise.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, the media blackout has intensified in parallel to an escalation of the violence toward the protestors. The latest report is that following night protests in Watergaam, an injured youth remains in critical condition. The curfew is planned to remain until Friday. Much can happen to protesters without the eyes of the world on Kashmir to witness their plight. The curfew is still in place as this press release is being written and we have received reports from people in Kashmir that there is a shortage of essential supplies.We asked to all Anons to join us in helping lifting the curfew, and re-establish a media presence and the internet to make sure the Kashmiris are safe from repression and their aspirations are heard by the world.</p>

<p>Greeting’s citizens of the World. We’d like to give you tonights entertainment.</p>
<p>It has come to the attention of the collective that the Indian Military has been committing multiple human rights abuses in Kashmir. These stem from arresting protestors to systematically raping villages, all in the attempt of crushing dissent and forcing obedience.</p>
<p>The unlawful occupation of Kashmir has been something that has been swept under the rug of international affairs. It appears that Human Rights is a term that has been tossed around for only the convenience of political parties. It appears that Human Rights don’t matter when it is a country that presents a financial interest to the United States of America. This struggle has gone on for decades in the worst styles of abuse, but has gone largely ignored.</p>
<p>So we come to today, while protestors in Kashmir have, yet again, taken to the streets, Anonymous has taken to the internet in support of their struggle. The current protests regards the un-investigated deaths of 358 infant deaths in Srinagar. Omar Abdullah has failed to address the problem during his visits to the region. He has felt it justified to sweep these incidents under the rug.</p>
<p>But Anonymous does not forget, and neither do the people of Kashmir. We have acted in support of the protests on the ground. The people are calling for their promised plebiscite. We will continue to press for reform in the region of Kashmir. The acts of the Indian Military Machine in that region have gone on long enough.</p>
<p>The facts remain. The people of Kashmir do not feel the are embraced as people of India. When a country refuses you medical attention due to the region you come from, you fail to be a part of that country. Independence from India remains the only viable option to the people of Kashmir.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, we do NOT support any other claims to the region, spare the claims made by the people of Kashmir.</p>
<p>In support of the protestors of Kashmir we have taken down the following sites:<br />
Jknc.in<br />
jkpolice.gov.in<br />
indianarmy.nic.in</p>
<p>We have not permanently damaged these sites, nor have we harmed the infrastructure of India. We have simply shown our support to the protestors of Kashmir in the best way Anonymous knows. By organizing our own virtual sit-ins.</p>
<p>We will continue to do so, along side the people protesting on the ground. As long as feet march in the region Anonymous will bring down websites.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kashmir a beautiful valley amidst the Great Himalayas. Kashmir also known as the Paradise on the Earth with a Great History. Kashmir’s killing fields dwarf that of Palestine and any other bloodied place.</p>
<p>Kashmir is an International Dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947. Kashmiris have been fighting for their Right to Self Determination since 1947 after a Controversial Accession to India by the Despotic Hindu Ruler of Kashmir.It is worth mentioning that the ‘so-called’ instrument of accession has never been shown to Kashmiris, UN or for that matter Pakistan. Part of Kashmir (49000 sq km) is under the occupation of China.</p>
<p>Kashmiris don’t regard themselves as “Indians” or Pakitanis for that matter and they have been fighting to determine their Future themselves which has been denied by India and Pakistan. Kashmiris were promised a plebiscite by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru &amp; that promise has not been fulfilled till this day.</p>
<p>Kashmiris started demanding Independence/Self Determination in early 1990s with an Armed Rebellion(which is believed to be funded by Pakistan) after elections of 1987 were rigged in favor on National Conference. The rebellion was crushed by the Mighty Indian Forces with Brutal Massacres,Torture,Custodial Disappearances,Mass Rapes and much more brutal action. It is estimated that there are around 400 rebels in Kashmir and the Total Indian Forces here is often estimated to 700,000 (Separatists exaggerate the Figure to One Million) Kashmir is the Highest Military Zone, with a Civilian-Troop Ration of 15:1 (Higher than that of Iraq and Afghanistan) Since 1990 it is estimated that the Conflict has wiped an entire generation, Figures of those killed is as high as 100,000. In the early 1990s Pandits (Native Hindus) were forced to flee Kashmir out of fear which was facilitated by the State of India esp. the then Governor Jagmohan. About 300,000 Pandits fled the Valley, i.e 2.5% of Kashmir Valley, but some did stay back and no one harmed them and Sikhs stayed back as well no one harmed them except for the Chattinsingpora Massacre carried out by Indain Army acc. to the Sikhs . Some statistics of the Kashmir Conflict:</p>
<p>Total Killings * 93,241<br />
Custodial Killings 6,969<br />
Civilians Arrested 117,117<br />
Structures Arsoned/Destroyed 105,845<br />
Women Widowed 22,726<br />
Children Orphaned 107,347<br />
Women gang-raped / Molested 9,912</p>
<p>January 1989 to May 31, 2010<br />
*including custodial killings and the killings continue till this day!</p>
<p>In 2008, Kashmiris transitioned there movement to Peaceful Protests. But still it was crushed with brute force by Indian Forces. More than 65 were Killed. In 2009, two girls were raped and murdered in the South Kashmir town of Shopian, massive protests were registered by the people of Kashmir against the incident but the incident was dubbed as a ‘drowning incident’ by India and brushed under the carpet.In 2010, Kashmiris came on the streets for months together. Indian Forces again used brute force using tear-gas canisters,live ammunition and pellet guns.For days Kashmiris were left starving with declared and undeclared curfews and with threats of Shoot at sight orders. More than 120 Kashmiris were killed. From seven year old boy Sameer (who was crushed with Jackboots to death) to 22 Year old Girl Fancy Jan, who was just standing near a window. Most of the slain were teenagers.</p>
<p>India is able to continue its ‘illegal’ occupation in Kashmir by using draconian laws which violate Human rights in the worst possible ways, in the face of the International Community, some of them are:<br />
1.JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR PUBLIC SAFETY ACT, 1978<br />
The Act promulgated in 1978 (amended in 1987 and 1990) empowers the State government to detain a person without trial for two years under the pretext of maintenance of public order.</p>
<p>2.JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR DISTURBED AREAS ACT, 1990<br />
Under the Act, the whole or part of the State can be declared disturbed area by the Central Government or the Governor. The whole valley of Kashmir and two Districts of Jammu have since been declared disturbed areas. An official of the level of Head Constable is allowed to use force or shoot (and kill) under the pretext of maintaining the public order</p>
<p>3.TERRORIST AND DISRUPTIVE ACTIVITIES ACT (TADA) 1990 :<br />
The Act enforced in 1985 (amended in 1987) gives security forces and armed forces special powers for use of force, especially the amendment of 1987 made it tougher. It was widely used for unauthorized administrative detention without formal charges or trial for upto one year.</p>
<p>4.THE ARMED FORCES (JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR) SPECIAL POWERS ACT, 1990<br />
The Armed Forces (Jammu &amp; Kashmir) Special Powers Ordinance, introduced in July, 1990, was later enacted by the Parliament of India and enforced on 10th September, 1990.
