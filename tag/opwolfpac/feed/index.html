<p>Greetings Citizens of the World.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Money is corrupting our political system, controlling our politicians, lawmakers, and elections. We now live in a &#8220;plutonomy&#8221; (as the leaked Citigroup memos below attest), a country controlled solely by corporate influences and the wealthy; no longer is the US a true democratic nation.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theyoungturks">The Young Turks </a>an independent online news organization], we have already moved to address this problem. Three years ago from this coming Monday, January 21, the Supreme Court delivered its ruling in the controversial case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (see link below). This declared that corporations are &#8220;people&#8221; and removed all restrictions on corporate political expenditures.</p>
<p>The Young Turks started a political action committee called Wolf PAC, committed to overturning Citizens United by way of a 28th Constitutional Amendment. However their campaign is struggling and ends this coming Monday on the anniversary of the ruling. They have a matching funds drive of up to $50,000 and at the time of this writing they are a little over $31,000 short. This fundraising campaign will help them hire staff, run ads, and inform people how much power they still have if they are willing to stand up and DEMAND a true, representative democracy. If everyone reading this donated even one dollar, we could help them reach their goal in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Wolf PAC is one giant step on the journey to end corruption.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do Not Forgive<br />
We do Not Forget</p>
<p>United States, Expect Us.</p>
