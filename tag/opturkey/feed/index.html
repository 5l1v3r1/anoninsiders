<p>Citizens of Turkey, we are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, September 10th, we will launch coordinated cyber attacks against the Turkish government&#8217;s pathetic cyber security. We will dedicate our hacks to the people that have died fighting against the fascist government of Turkey.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people gathered in the upmarket Istanbul district, to vent anger over the deaths of 10 construction employees. The workers were killed Saturday when their elevator crashed. Protesters organized accordingly to express their outrage at what they see as Turkey&#8217;s lack of both funds &#038; safety measures regarding construction sites and workplaces.</p>
<p>Yet, by speculation, this was not an accident, but murder.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500"><p>19 years old died at the same site before. Safety precautions and relevant checks forfeited. Company Torunlar GYO has links to AKP gov&#39;t.</p>
<p>&mdash; RedHack_EN ★ (<a href="https://twitter.com/RedHack_EN" rel="nofollow">&commat;RedHack_EN</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/RedHack_EN/status/508419759223107584">September 7, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The riot police responded to the protests with brute force, firing water cannons and dispersing rallies by throwing tear gas at peaceful protesters.</p>
<p>Erdogan and the new Prime Minister Ahmed, along with their police forces who have deteriorated and infringed the very rights of the people they claim to protect, and their autocratic motives to strip away the humanity of those in Turkey, will not walk by unpunished, or unnoticed.</p>
<p>This unjust event was one of many that still holds the Turkish government accountable. From Gezi, to Soma, To Berkin Elvan, the Turkish government and their bastardized police forces have once again crossed the red line.</p>
<p>We will show the world that our actions will not go silent, and our effects, will remain permanent.</p>
<p>Operation Turkey, engaged.</p>

<p>Government of Turkey, expect us.</p>

<p>Greetings Government of Turkey,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>We have watched for days with horror as our brothers and sisters in Turkey who are peacefully rising up against their tyrannical government have been brutalized, beaten, run over with riot vehicles, shot with water cannons and gassed in the streets. From the epicenter of their revolution in Taksim Square to every city in Turkey, the people have spoken. Hundreds of thousands have taken and held the streets for days, despite the relentless assault of the police. Thousands have been arrested. Where differ you exactly from a Junta!</p>
<p>Turkey is supposed to be a so called &#8220;modern&#8221; democracy, but the Turkish government behaves like the petty dictators in China or Iran. Anonymous is outraged by this behavior, and we will unite across the globe and bring the Turkish government to it&#8217;s knees. We will attack every internet and communications asset of the Turkish government. You have censored social media and other communications of your people in order to suppress the knowledge of your crimes against them. Now Anonymous will shut you down, and your own people will remove you from power.</p>
<p>We have seen in the past your totalitarianism the same as with Mubarak you know what happend to him don&#8217;t do this to ur own people bee wise and step down and let the people decide there fate.</p>
<p>To the people of Turkey No matter how dark it may seem, no matter how alone and abandoned you may feel know that the world is watching. Know that anonymous is working tirelessly around the clock to bring you every assistance., know that Anonymous stands with you in this fight. Don&#8217;t be ruled by them but rule over them &#8220;Think For Yourself, Question Authority&#8221; .</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Government of Turkey, it is too late to Expect us.</p>
