				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Fellow Canadians &amp; Citizens of the World!</p>
<p>We are Anonymous!</p>
<p>Back on Dec. 2nd 2012. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpFuckHarper" rel="nofollow">#OpFuckHarper</a> put out a Press Release ( <a href="http://pastebin.com/BfrN6jws">http://pastebin.com/BfrN6jws</a> ) detailing that Micheal Sona was ONE of the parties responsible for the Robocall scandal that undermined the Democratic process of Canada. FiVE MONTHS after the fact. The Courts caught up with us and finally got around to laying charges. As detailed here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-tory-staffer-becomes-first-person-charged-in-robo-calls-probe/article10687099/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-tory-staffer-becomes-first-person-charged-in-robo-calls-probe/article10687099/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/04/02/pol-michael-sona-charged-under-elections-act.html">http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/04/02/pol-michael-sona-charged-under-elections-act.html</a></p>
<p>Sona and his representation have <a href="http://pastebin.com/aReXgLwM">released the following statement</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to actually support Sona on PORTIONS of this statement. He alone is NOT THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE for this. While he still played a major part, He definitely involved just about everyone else he had access to in the process. Spreading the blame and complicity in the crimes far and wide throughout the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>We would now like to take this time to reaffirm the OTHER parties responsible for all of this, As stated verbatim in our previous Press Release <a href="http://pastebin.com/BfrN6jws">http://pastebin.com/BfrN6jws</a> which clearly enough of you didn&#8217;t read.</p>
<p>&#8220;namely Conservative Riding Association President John White, Conservative Marty Burke &amp; his Campaign Manager Ken Morgan (Fled to Kuwait&#8230;), Deputy Campaign Manager Andrew Prescott (Laying low in Alberta&#8230;)&#8221;</p>
<p>Our understanding of how this went down according to Elections Canada records is as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Director of Communications Micheal Sona confided in Campaign Manager Ken Morgan and at his direction reached out to Conservative Matthew McBain, who then confided in Riding Association President John White with Sona&#8217;s intentions, after which time Sona tasked Deputy Campaign Manager Andrew Prescott with setting up a &#8216;untraceable&#8217; RackNine account to put out the fraudulent calls.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have reviewed the Elections Canada evidence again with a fine tooth comb, and we have no retractions to make. In addition we would like to point out the following details we missed the first time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request for contact details for RackNine from Micheal Sona and Ken Morgan sent at 5:30 04/30/2011 by Andrew Prescott</li>
<li>RackNine contacted by &#8216;Pierre Jones&#8217; 9:07 04/30/2011</li>
<li>Prescott denied subsequent interviews with EC Investigators</li>
<li>Morgan withheld expense details from the Official Campaign Agent Abdul-Qayum Ali</li>
<li>McBain conferred with White on 04/26/2011 and 04/27/2011 detailing Sona&#8217;s intentions.</li>
<li>Sona inquired about setting up untraceable calls to McBain. McBain advised that this was indicative of unbecoming behavior. McBain ceases contact with Sona after this. McBain does NOT follow up with White.</li>
<li>White, while brought into the fold on this, DID NOT bring this to the attention of Campaign Manager Ken Morgan (who likely already knew), He did not speak about it TO ANYONE, even after the news broke that fraudulent calls were occurring Guelph, where Sona is Director of Communications</li>
<li>Chris Crawford, the person responsible for managing CIMS Database/List, overheard Sona describing exactly the type of fraud that occured. He even told Sona that was he was advocating was illegal and inappropriate</li>
<li>Crawford was found to have accessed CIMS Database no less then 14 times from the hacked Rogers WiFi WHILE IN THE CAMPAIGN OFFICE</li>
<li>This means they had the hacked credentials stored and saved. this is why activity from ALL Guelph Campaign staffers occur from that address. It was not removed from the priority list of which connections to use. (Being Anonymous, We know a thing or two about hacking WiFi you see ..)</li>
<li>Prescott and Morgan consistently deny interviews by EC Investigators</li>
<li>32 out of 41 CIMS Database accesses were done via the hacked Rogers WiFi, by far the majority. It is also worth noting that Andrew Prescott used his Personal Credit Card for the RackNine payments. It was shown that the fraudulent account was paid for using PrePaid Credit Cards. It would be worth checking to see if Prescott has a transaction for $460 worth of PrePaid Credit Cards from Shoppers Drug Mart. These same Cards were used to pay for the fraudulent RackNine account.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Fellow Canadians &amp; Citizens of the World!</p>
<div>We are Anonymous.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For far too long we&#8217;ve watched the fraudulently elected Harper get away with travesties against our rights. Bill after bill proposed that erodes our Privacy and Freedoms. Crime Minister Harper seems more concerned with importing Chinese Law and secret foreign courts over Canadian resources and markets. Not to mention acting as a shill for Israel threatening Palestine and shaming Canadians on the International Stage clearly associating the United States, Canada and Israeli Governments in their corrupt and perverse alignments of policy. Palestine is so offended that they are severing all ties with Canadians and removing them in any aspect from the peace process they are just beginning with their newly found UN Sanctioned Statehood.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The primary focus of Operation Fuck Harper is to get Harper to stop fucking us! Which basically means seeing Harper out of power (ie: The House of Commons passing a Motion of No Confidence) and a Government at least moderately representative of the people is established. We hold no disillusions that the other party will be any better, but at this rate anyone is better than Harper.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The secondary focus of Operation Fuck Harper is to bring further recognition and present new evidence to the fact that Harper was fraudulently elected to power via Voter Suppression facilitated by his party members, namely Conservative Riding Association President John White, Conservative Marty Burke &amp; his Campaign Manager Ken Morgan (Fled to Kuwait&#8230;), Deputy Campaign Manager Andrew Prescott (Laying low in Alberta&#8230;) &amp; Director of Communications Micheal Sona through a scheme unknowingly involving RackNine to misdirect Liberal and otherwise non-Conservative voters to non-existent polling stations the week/day/night of voting. There is well over 10,000 documented cases of such calls all across Canada&#8230;and those are just the ones we can prove!</div>
<div></div>
<div>We have included for your review and distribution, The Official Elections Canada Court Informant Records regarding the case. In this document it is conclusively proved that Guelph Conservative Campaign Staffers were responsible for the fraudulent elections calls. We will briefly summarize the facts here.</div>
<div></div>
<div>RackNine, A by contract Conservative Only Call Center for Election Calls, was paid $162.10 for 7,676 calls to a total of 6,738 numbers by RackNine Client #93, &#8216;Pierre Poutine&#8217; aka Pierre Jones. RackNine Client #45, Andrew Prescott also paid RackNine $400 for legitimate Conservative Election calls. Both accounts were accessed by the same workstation and IP Addresses in the Guelph Conservative Campaign Office.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Client #93 authenticates to RackNine under a still active session belonging to Client #45 on 05/02/2011 from 99.225.28.34 . Similarly there were 3 occurrences on 05/01 and 05/02/2011 during which Client #45 authenticated to RackNine while still under an active session belonging to Client #93 . Two of these authentications occurred from 64.64.11.39 for Client #45 , The same IP Address used to fund and manage Client #93 . The fact that the same session id was used indicates that the exact same workstation was used within minutes of each other to initiate the fraudulent calls using a Call List that is IDENTICAL to an INTERNAL Conservative List of OPPONENTS dated 04/27/2011.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The conclusions we have drawn from this is that Director of Communications Micheal Sona confided in Campaign Manager Ken Morgan and at his direction reached out to Conservative Matthew McBain, who then confided in Riding Association President John White with Sona&#8217;s intentions, after which time Sona tasked Deputy Campaign Manager Andrew Prescott with setting up a &#8216;untraceable&#8217; RackNine account to put out the fraudulent calls.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And this ladies and gentlemen&#8230;is just 1 riding.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Court documents filed in mid-August, 2012, by the Commissioner of Elections Canada indicated that the elections watchdog had received reports of fraudulent or misleading calls in 234 of Canada&#8217;s 308 ridings&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>When we have supporting documentation and evidence for those ridings. We will put out another Press Release. If you happen to be in possession or can direct us to this documentation and/or evidence please e-mail OpAnonRevival@gmail.com</div>
