<p>Dear Citizens of the World,</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that Hollywood, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America will continue their attacks on freedoms in the name of copyright and financial profits. We see continual acts of aggression from the United States government in defense of this money hungry corrupt business model. These associations refuse to update their business model with the changing of times. The cost of their profits have come down to stripping you of your rights with things such as SOPA, PIPA, CISPA, Six Strikes and many other actions. We have all witnessed activists aggressively targeted, until they feel they have no choice other than suicide. It is time we fought back by directly attacking them financially.</p>
<p>Last year we attempted OpBlackMarch. It was a great idea, but had some issues fundamentally. One of the biggest problems was a lack of participation and any way of showing effectiveness. This year we will call for a boycott of one movie a month in preparation for boycotting the summer block buster&#8217;s. The first target will be a movie titled &#8220;Oblivion&#8221; starring Tom Cruise. (Because, fuck Tom Cruise). It will be coming out April 27th. Do not go see this movie on its opening day or during its opening weekend. If the thought of not watching this movie is too much to bear we recommend you pirate it instead. (protect yourself via VPN, or proxy). We will be getting real time updates on the success or failure due to financial reports from various media outlets. Please encourage everyone you know to participate.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
Hollywood; expect us!</p>
