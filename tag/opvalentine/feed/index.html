				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpPenPal" rel="nofollow">#OpPenPal</a> began as <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a> approximately one year ago, when a group of activists banded together to encourage the people of the interwebz to send love via snail mail to our imprisoned comrades for Valentine’s day. Our brothers and sisters have been taken away from us. Some of the best and brightest of our generation are locked away from the world in an effort to silence them and make us forget. But we are Legion. We do not forgive, we do not forget. We leave no one behind.</p>
<p>Our comrades are accused of working to make government transparent and accountable to the people. They are accused of setting information free. They are accused of opposing war and crimes committed under its banner. They are accused of disrupting financial institutions that have themselves disrupted and ruined the lives of millions. We do not believe these actions or the people being charged for them are dangerous. The acts that they are accused of can at worst be called civil disobedience and whistle blowing. Yet the government has already decided they are guilty, holding some for years without a trial.</p>
<p>We launch <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opValentine" rel="nofollow">#opValentine</a> as an ongoing action in support of Anons and other activists navigating the nightmare of the “justice” system. Anyone can join this operation &#8211; find a pen, some paper, and a stamp. We may be from the Internet, but we are backward compatible. Let a political prisoner know they are not forgotten.</p>
<p>FreeAnons is a group dedicated to helping all people who are arrested and charged with crimes pertaining to Anonymous. They help find legal aid, donate funds for travel, and generally are just amazing for supporting our friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where will we be on Valentine&#8217;s day? With whom? One thing is certain, most of us will have the freedom to tell whom we care &#8220;I love you&#8221; and shower them with hugs. Separated from their friends, their family, all of their love ones, many of our brothers and sisters will be deprived of this most basic human right. They have sacrificed their freedom to expose corruption and human rights violations. And as would say Che: &#8220;At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love.&#8221; So, Valentine day is a most appropriate occasion to share in their spirit and remind them, that their isolation is only physical. They are not alone, not forgotten and we stand with them and care. So lets our Valentine day cards show that we are indeed Legion, that we do do forget and that our gratitude and solidarity can be expected.</p>

Saturday May 19, 2012 five men were arrested in Tinley Park, a Chicago Suburb, for allegedly assaulting a number of white-supremacist organizers. One of the alleged “victims” was arrested on warrants for child pornography and another was arrested for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.</p>
<p>All 5 have accepted a non-cooperating plea bargain and are being transferred to other facilities to serve their sentences, ranging from 3.5 to 6 years each. As we receive their new mailing info, we will add it here.</p>

<p>FreeAnons  is launching <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, which is an effort to send incarcerated  Anonymous, activists, and political prisoners Valentines. As a society,  the most ominous question that Anonymous actions ask to all of us,  techies and techtards is: when doing solely what is legal stops to be  moral? That is for you, the reader, to answer. Many Anons and activists  dare crossing the line. Of course the Corporate State will spin its own  yarn for popular consumption which will be repeated by the usual status  quo mouthpieces. It seems unavoidable, since Socrates was condemned to  drink hemlock, that those who hold the power try to reframe our  experience, making us doubt our own heart and our own conscience.  What  cannot be doubted is that these people never committed a violent crime  and never acted for personal profit but out of moral conviction.  Their  engagement comes loaded with possible consequences. Many have already  been arrested and are serving jail sentences for having the courage to  stand. With <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, we want to remind Jeremy, Christopher, Josh,  Barrett and all the others that they may be behind bars, but they are  not left behind as long as we stand with them and for them. For more  info and addresses visit the <a href="http://freeanons.org/articles/"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeAnons" rel="nofollow">#FreeAnons</a> website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>FreeAnons is happy to support <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, which is an effort to send incarcerated Anonymous, Activists, and Political prisoners Valentines.</strong> Separated from their friends, their family, all of their love ones, many of our brothers and sisters will be deprived of this most basic human right.
