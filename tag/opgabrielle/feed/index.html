<p>Greetings World</p>
<p>We are Anonymous. In the past year, we have come to the defense of and sought revenge for numerous individuals who have been either bullied, raped &#8211; or otherwise victimized by their peers. From Canada to Ohio, we have shown online bullies and in real life tormentors that there will be a new price to pay for their unspeakable crimes against the innocent. We are tired of watching young people take their own lives, or live in insufferable despair because they were raped, attacked &#8211; and tormented by bullies. These Anonymous Operations have actually manifested an entire new genre called by some the &#8220;Justice Ops&#8221;. And today we launch yet another: Operation Gabrielle.</p>
<p>On Wednesday &#8211; May 22, 2013 12 year old Gabrielle Molina took her own life by hanging herself in Queens, New York &#8211; USA. She had been being tormented and bullied to the point of such despair that this poor innocent 12 year old girl felt her only relief was death. We will deal with her tormentors below. But where were her teachers? Where were her councilors? Where was the school administrators? And where were the parents of the juvenile criminals who tormented this poor girl to her grave?</p>
<p>Anonymous makes the following demands:</p>
<p>1) We demand that ALL the juvenile criminals who tormented this girl both online and in real life come forward, and together with their parents draft and sign a public letter of apology to Gabrielle Molina&#8217;s family and loved ones. We WILL find out the names of each and every person who bullied this young child to her death, and we will find the online evidence of these unspeakable acts. If you do not step forward and comply with our above demand we will expose your name and the evidence of your crimes publicly for the world to see &#8211; regardless of your age. And we will expose your parents and/or guardians as well. To those who directly tormented this child, and to your parents: you have 48 hours to draft this letter of apology, sign it &#8211; and publish it to mainstream media. Failure to comply will result in your exposure along with all the evidence.</p>
<p>2) We demand that the Superintendent of Schools in Queens convene an investigation into the teachers, councilors and administrators who clearly failed in their moral responsibility and allowed this child to be bullied to her death. And we demand that any who are found to be negligent in any way be terminated at once. You have 48 hours to convene this investigation and publish that fact to mainstream media. Failure to comply with this demand will result in Anonymous conducting it&#8217;s OWN investigation, using our own unique techniques &#8211; and we will publicly shame with evidence every single adult in this child&#8217;s life and school who let her down and allowed this tragedy to happen.</p>
<p>Queens, New York: half measures will avail you nothing. Comply now with our demands fully and save yourself us turning your town inside out as we did in Steubenville, Ohio. The choice is yours. Do the right thing, or we will do it for you.</p>
