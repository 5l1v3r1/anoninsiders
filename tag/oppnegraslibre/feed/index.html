				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    Piedras Negras, Mexico<br />
    (Border City with Eagle Pass, Texas)</p>
<p>    Although Anonymous FREEACUNA was born in Acuña, Mexico (border city with Del Rio, Texas) this year, after achieving credible results as Mexican and American press describe in the articles below, we are now ready for our first expansion into the city of Piedras Negras, Mexico.</p>
<p>    ANONYMOUS VS. LOS ZETAS: THE REVENGE OF THE HACKTIVISTS (June 2013)<br />
    http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/anonymous-vs-los-zetas-the-revenge-of-the-hacktivists</p>
<p>    ‘ZETAS HAVE ANONYMOUS FOES’ &#8211;  San Antonio Express News (June 2013)<br />
    http://www.expressnews.com/news/local_news/article/Zetas-have-Anonymous-foes-4566921.php?t=a14bf38534d95dc057</p>
<p>     ‘EL GRUPO DE HACKERS QUE CASI DESARTICULA A LOS ZETAS. LA BATALLA SILENCIOSA DE ANONYMOUS EN CIUDAD ACUÑA, MEXICO’  &#8211; YoSoyRED (June 2013)<br />
    http://yosoyred.com/2013/06/el-grupo-que-casi-desarticula-a-los-zetas-la-batalla-silenciosa-de-anonymous-en-ciudad-acuna-mexico/</p>
<p>    Therefore, we ANONYMOUS FREEACUNA make the following declaration:</p>
<p>    OBJETIVE:<br />
    As of August 12, 2013 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpPNegrasLibre" rel="nofollow">#OpPNegrasLibre</a> has started. Our main objective is to identify the complete structure of the ZETAS operating in Piedras Negras starting with its leader known as “MARBORO”. Although our fight started against the ZETAS eventually we will fight the Cartel del Golfo (CDG) as all cartels are a clear and present danger to our people in Mexico.</p>
<p>    METODOLOGY</p>
<p>    1.      As of this moment the following email address is available to the law abiding and concerned citizens of Piedras Negras so that they may have direct access to us ANONYMOUS FREEACUNA it is piedrasnegraslibre@hushmail.com</p>
<p>    2.      We will answer valuable emails not from this email address but from other email addresses in order to avoid detection.<br />
    3.      What are we seeking? We need the name of “MARBORO” the new ZETA leader of Piedras. We are seeking information on narco businesses in Piedras Negras an Eagle Pass that are connected with the ZETAS and with the CDG for that matter as well. We are seeking the names and aliases of ZETAS and Halcones.</p>
<p>    FINAL OUTCOME</p>
<p>    With the information obtained, we ANONYMOUS FREEACUNA will be able to do what we do best, identify servers, email accounts, and accounts where the truth has been held captive. We do not trust in our own authorities in Mexico but several organizations outside our country have shown the willingness to join our fight. It is for this reason that <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpPNegrasLibre" rel="nofollow">#OpPNegrasLibre</a> has started with the Alias of the leader of the ZETAS in Piedras Negras – “MARBORO”.</p>
<p>    This is your time Piedras Negras and Eagles Pass to release yourself from the grip of not only the ZETAS but of any other cartel that seeks to enslave you.</p>
<p>    We ARE Anonymous FREEACUNA<br />
    We ARE Legion<br />
    We do NOT forgive<br />
    We do NOT forget<br />
    Do your job Piedras Negras and Eagles Pass and send us an email: piedrasnegraslibre@hushmail.com</p>
