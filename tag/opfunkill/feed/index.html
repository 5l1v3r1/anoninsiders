This one’s for you.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/113804974?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=cccccc" width="620" height="348" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Pressure has been mounting on you since the activist documentary Blackfish was released earlier in the year. Since then, your true nature has become apparent. Even your own investors are fleeing in the hundreds as your company crashes day after day on the New York Stock Exchange. The most loyal of your share holders have encountered a 51% loss in value, and we will take the rest!</p>
<p>SeaWorld &#8211; You are the walking dead.<br />
We’ve already done the dissection!<br />
Here is the autopsy:</p>
<p>You died because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of Orca Kidnap and Murder. 51 have died in your care! 160 total have died in captivity.</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of funding Taiji Dolphin Trade that also slaughter entire Dolphin pods for sushi!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of lying to trainers about safety, and blaming them when they die!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of lying to customers and the media on numerous subjects.</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of brainwashing children with your toys.</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of stealing baby Penguins and have never denied this.</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of continuing to appeal a court order to ban trainers in the water!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of drugging even the pregnant Orcas with Valium!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of artificial insemination breeding prior to Orca sexual maturity!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of drilling down the teeth on Orcas without anesthetic!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of spending only 1% on rescue and rehabilitation!</li>
<li>You have been found GUILTY of spin doctoring yourselves as a conservation oriented entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>SeaWorld – Your history of secretive abuse is now known. Your lies and cheap misdirection marketing tricks will no longer be possible. Your ability to trick the public will be destroyed. We will remove it! Continuing to attempt any profitable venture in it’s current form is now futile.</p>
<p>Anonymous has been looking with growing interest, and you now have our attention. We recently learned that your dwindling attendance in US parks has spurned you to expansion abroad. We will be there, fighting you on every battle front to stop this from happening.<br />
And once the time comes to empty the tanks, we will be watching and making sure you do the job right. Enjoy your funeral, because it is too late to expect us.</p>
<p>Welcome to Operation SeaWorld.<br />
That is all.<br />

<p>Welcome to OpFunKill!<br />
We do not stand for animal abuse!</p>
<p>We are the voices of the animals.<br />
We are the ones in the shadows.<br />
You can not stop, what you can not see.</p>
<p>We are many.  We fight as one!</p>
<p>OpFunKill was created to hunt and expose the hunters.  We are opposed to trophy hunting, and any form of hunting for entertainment.  We are the voice of the voiceless. We are against animal abuse of any kind.  We are against the illegal trade in exotic animals.  We are against the ivory trade.  We are against unsustainable hunting for pleasure and the governments who’s laws enable it.</p>
<p>For too long the world has watched in horror at the barbaric nature of those involved in all of the above, and OpFunKill has been engaged to attack and expose animal abusers.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpFunKill" rel="nofollow">#OpFunKill</a>.<br />
We are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Anonymous" rel="nofollow">#Anonymous</a>.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings citizens of the World.  We are Anonymous!</p>
<p><iframe width="620" height="340" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ou1kJzMjVJE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For a long time now we have been watching with horror, the cruelty that some members of the human race seem capable of inflicting upon animals.  Issues such as trophy hunting, dog smuggling, animal testing, whaling, shark and dolphin fishing, destruction of habitats, inhumane slaughter houses, dog fighting, bull fighting, and the trade in ivory, rhino horn and exotic animals, and fur clothing.</p>
<p>Greedy corporations are destroying nature and the corruption of governments allow it. 99% of this is happening for one reason only.  MONEY!</p>
<p>Unspeakable and terrible things happen every second of every day while the whole planet is forced to watch, as these cold hearted soulless zombies cause horrific suffering and death to animals, both common, vulnerable and critically endangered species.</p>
<p>The time has come for Anonymous to stand united against such acts.  We say NO to these issues and it is now time to raise our collective voice, as a voice for the voiceless. It is time to say NO to the destruction of this planet and the creatures that live upon it.  </p>
<p>We have been researching, probing, scanning, and preparing to strike. Our targets have been warned and soon it will be time to act!  We are Operation FunKill; a united collective of operations, hackers and activists who stand together against cruelty.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for animal abuse, and now the animals will fight back. Judgement has been passed. U can not disperse us; neither can stop us. You can not kill a hydra by cutting off the head and we are like the shadow behind you, following your every move.</p>
<p>Every day we grow stronger as more people hear about us.  And as we grow our anger grows with us, as does our voice and our power.  This power will stand for animal rights and as long these rights are disrespected, we will be here, ripping through your servers, hacking, leaking, deleting and defacing as we go, spreading our message without mercy or restraint.</p>
<p>Like those who act against animals without mercy, we will show no mercy to you.  It is time to hunt the hunters!</p>
<p>This is not a threat.  This is a promise!  We are the new face of animal rights.  We are the final boss of the internet. We are Operation Fun Kill.</p>
<p>And we are Anonymous.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive!<br />
We do not forget!<br />
Abusers… Expect us!</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
