<p>Mass Media still not covering Rohingya Genocide. Does covering a genocide increases ad revenue or decrease it ? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RohingyaSOS" rel="nofollow">#RohingyaSOS</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpRohingya" rel="nofollow">#OpRohingya</a> Twitterstorm Package! v2.0</p>
<p>First Twitter Storm begins today at 9pm GMT (2pm PST, 5pm EST) With another to follow four hours later. This will hopefully keep the trend up so we can get as many signatures as we can for the petitions etc.</p>
<p><a title="Operation Rohingya – Ultimate twitterstorm to stop Muslims massacres" href="http://anoninsiders.net/operation-rohingya-1375/">Our press release has over 9,000 hits</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA-z3ytS5nE">Our official <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpRohingya" rel="nofollow">#OpRohingya</a> video has over 13,000 views.</a></p>
<p>Our movement is beginning to gain coverage and momentum, though not nearly as much as is needed.</p>
<p>We will not be silenced until the voices of the persecuted in Myanmar/Burma are heard. We will not stop until someone listens. This is an outcry from humanity to human beings.</p>
<p>Just about a third of the internet uses Twitter. If we can get all of Twitter talking about this movement, the internet has to listen.</p>
<p>Important NOTE: We are trying to push this article (http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-rohingya-movement-as-seen-by-a-journalist-in-burma ) as much as possible, it has everything other journalists need to know to cover this. PLEASE RT as much as possible to spread this article, it is ESSENTIAL.</p>

<p>Greetings Citizens of the World.</p>
<p>It is vital the information we are going to share with you is made viral as quickly as possible. The ethnic Rohingya people of Myanmar Burma in Southeast Asia are about to be massacred. Barbarous acts are being carried out by Neo-Nazi racist groups like the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party, Arakan Liberation Army, NaSaKa border police and 969 monks led by Monk Wirathu, the self proclaimed Bin Laden of Buddhism. The Government of Myanmar is orchestrating these crimes.</p>
<p>The persecution of the Rohingya people is severe. The Burmese junta considers them to be sub-human and denies them almost all basic human rights. They are subject to torture, gang rape, starvation, slave labor, and forced to reside in the most dire camps in the world &#8211; some call these refugee camps but they are actually concentration camps. Over the past few months, thousands of Rohingya have been encouraged onto boats and sent out to sea with not enough food or fuel, and left there to die. Many boats were attacked and sunk, with women and children on board.</p>
<p>Already the violence in Burma has spread beyond the Rohingya to include all Muslims, with ‘warm ups’ to the anticipated massacre taking place against Burmese Muslims in Meiktila, Naypyidaw and Yangon. Dead and burning bodies, including children, are now lying in the streets.</p>
<p>While the United States claims to defend human rights, their record clearly reflects a government that will only intercede when their business interests are threatened. While politicians occasionally pay lip service to the horrific conditions in Myanmar no action is ever taken. The only people neglecting the situation in Myanmar worse than the U.S. are the press who consistently ignored these atrocities or reported them as ‘ethnic clashes’. We consider the media to be complicit in concealing them from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The Rohingya have been told to expect a third massacre starting the last week in March. Rakhine have declared they will leave no Rohingya left on the land, just a few left as exhibits for the museum.</p>
<p>The acts of genocide being committed against the Rohingya people must no longer be ignored. We call on the Anonymous collective to stand with those for whom no one else will stand. We call on Anonymous and all supporters of human rights to stand against this great injustice, to give the Rohingya a voice, before they are completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Operation Rohingya engaged.<br />
We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Tyrants of the world, expect us!</p>
