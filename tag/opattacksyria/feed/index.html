				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings citizens of the world, we are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Oppressed people of Syria you have our undivided attention. For the past couple of years your country has been the subject of attacks from enemies both foreign and domestic, from corrupted politicians clinging to power, to actual terrorists funded and backed by Saudi Arabia posing as peaceful protesters. We have been watching as tragic events unfold, such as the on-going massacres between self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda members (the rebels) and the murderers known as the military of Assad. We condemn both their actions and call out to everyone to help end this bloody conflict.</p>
<p>We, the people of this planet, have had it enough. Stop the bloodshed, stop the violence, stop the hidden wars for control and resources or we will make you regret it. We will no longer stand for this, neither the Saudi Arabian Government&#8217;s interferance and their crude, barbaric way of treating their people, nor of Assad&#8217;s current immoral and irresponsible agenda of killing citizens in cold blood.</p>
<p>Together we will fight back against the wrongdoings of the Assad regime. Whether it be in the field or in cyberspace we will do our best to fight back. We have launched multiple cyberattacks on corporations in support of the regime. Those in support of the regime will be targeted.</p>
<p>With your support, Everything will be acheived, We have launched attacks on: mofa.gov.sa, mfa.gov.ir, president.ir, leader.ir, vaja.ir, mofa.gov.sy</p>
<p>Target list will be updated on daily basis. Don&#8217;t hesitate to visit us<br />
https://webchat.anonops.com/?channels=opattacksyria</p>
<p>[List redacted]</p>
<p>To show them our determination and strong will that we won&#8217;t be intimidated we have started yet another operation that even further advances our attacks on both cyber territories. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpAttackSyria" rel="nofollow">#OpAttackSyria</a> has begun!</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We Do Not Forgive<br />
We Do not Forget<br />
You Should Have Expected Us.</p>
