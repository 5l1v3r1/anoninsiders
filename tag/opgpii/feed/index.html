We are launching <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpGPII" rel="nofollow">#OpGPII</a>: Operation against Unnecessary Imposed Mega Projects, as an answer to the democratic deficit of this projects.</p>
<p>Since a few years, we see the capitalist systeme force the acceptation of the building of many projects judged today (with today’s awareness level) useless. That dying system, with its no sense projects, is taking us with him in its fall, and doesn’t hesitate, as recently, to go far enough to kill a person : Rémi Fraisse.</p>
<p>Facing the financiary Hold Ups, using essentially public found for the realisation of this projects, not helping the public debate, not giving any attention of the environnemental needs, using corruption to force this projects to happen, in the shadow, We, Anonymous, have decided to act to put the light on this projects that this system is calling progress when it actually means common death, for the only benefice of a few.</p>
