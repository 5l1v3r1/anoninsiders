<p>A message from Anonymous to the Government of North Korea.</p>
<p>Hello, citizens of the world. We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>North Korean government is increasingly becoming a threat to peace and freedom. Don&#8217;t misunderstand us: As well we disagree with the USA government too &#8211; these guys are crooks, USA is a threat to world peace too, and direct democracy or any kind of democracy doesn&#8217;t exist there.</p>
<p>The American government is a target and enemy of Anonymous as well! This is not about country vs country. This is about we, the people, the 99% of USA and of North Korea vs oppressing and violent regimes, like USA gov and North Korean gov! We, the people, are gathering together because we are stronger now and we won&#8217;t fight your wars anymore, we won&#8217;t eat your shit anymore!</p>
<p>We demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Korean government to stop making nukes and nuke-threats</li>
<li>Kim Jong-un to resign</li>
<li>It&#8217;s time to install a free direct democracy in North Korea</li>
<li>Uncensored internet access for all the citizens!</li>
</ul>
<p>To Kim Jong-un:<br />
So you feel the need to create large nukes and threaten half the world with them?<br />
So you&#8217;re into demonstrations of power, here is ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are inside your local intranets (Kwangmyong and others)</li>
<li>We are inside your mail servers</li>
<li>We are inside your web servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy these few records as a proof of our access to your systems, random innocent citizens, collateral damage, because they were stupid enough to choose idiot passwords, we got all over 15 000 membership records of www.uriminzokkiri.com and many more. First we gonna wipe your data, then we gonna wipe your badass dictatorship &#8220;government&#8221;.</p>
