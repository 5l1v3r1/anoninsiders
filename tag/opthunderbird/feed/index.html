				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its failure to properly investigate the cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, The Thunder Bay Police department follows the long Canadian tradition of ignoring the plight of the criminal violence visited upon First Nations women. Operation Thunderbird goals are to insure that justice is made in Thunderbay and to promote the safety of Native women in their communities. You can learn more and sign our petition by visiting our website at <a href="http://opthunderbird.tumblr.com/">OpThunderbird.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
<p>Our sisters are powerful.  Our sisters should expect to live without fear.</p>
<h2>Prefered method</h2>
<p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:anonymmis_opthunderbird@hushmail.com">anonymmis_opthunderbird@hushmail.com</a>. We strongly urge you to follow this procedure:  </p>
<p><strong>Hushmail</strong> is an encrypted email service which is basically impossible to hack. Law enforcement can only get Hushmail to turn over unencrypted emails with a court order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia or the Canadian Supreme Court.  Should it come to this, it will be better for you if you create a separate email address w/ hushmail or a similar service and use it only for communicating confidential information with us. Most importantly, if absolute confidentiality is important to you, open the new account using a Tor Browser (very easy to learn) and include no identifying information in the email.</p>
<p><strong>Not required but helpful</strong> There are rare cases we&#8217;ve heard of in which hushmail accounts are shut down (usually because their software thinks people using Tor and having the same IP must be using multiple accounts for spam).  To keep your information secure and permanent, you could create one of these ZeroBins (what we are using here), making it permanent and send the link that is created along in the email. It will be easier for us to store several links to ZeroBins of data than it will be to otherwise back up all of our email.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Direct Messaging on twitter <a href="https://twitter.co/<a href="https://twitter.com/Anony_mmis" rel="nofollow">&commat;Anony_mmis</a>"><a href="https://twitter.com/Anony_mmis" rel="nofollow">&commat;Anony_mmis</a></a>.  If volume grows high (as we hope!), this may be a less reliable route to leak information to us as high volumes of DMs with twitter can mysteriously disappear).  Twitter doesn&#8217;t encrypt such messages and does hand them over to law enforcement, but not, in the latter case, before giving you a heads up so you have chance to fight such a court order. DMs also require that you first ask us to follow you and then send us a DM.  This can grow unwieldy, but we realize this may be easier than creating a new email account on hushmail in Tor.</p>
<h2>For media</h2>
<p>Contact <a href="https://twitter.co/<a href="https://twitter.com/Anony_mmis" rel="nofollow">&commat;Anony_mmis</a>"><a href="https://twitter.com/Anony_mmis" rel="nofollow">&commat;Anony_mmis</a></a> publicly through twitter.</p>
