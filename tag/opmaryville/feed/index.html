				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greeting Anon Family and all people out of the World out there who give a fuck&#8230;thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Will keep this brief and will just paste article from <a href="https://twitter.com/Anomoly100" rel="nofollow">&commat;Anomoly100</a> to explain what this is about:</p>
<p>&#8220;Daisy Coleman, the Maryville Mo. teenager, who has been at the center of a rape case which made national headlines, was in a Kansas City hospital on Monday night after attempting to take her own life.</p>
<p>Much like the Steubenville rape case, the town turned on the victim.</p>
<p>Left outside in freezing cold weather to die, Coleman was unconscious and when found, her hair was frozen. A 13 year-old was raped as well. After charges were dropped, the family had to flee the town they lived in. Their home was burnt to the ground. The mother was fired from her job.</p>
<p>And now, Daisy attempted suicide after attending a party for about an hour on Saturday night, then received an onslaught of attacks immediately afterward on a number of Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>Melinda told MailOnline, “I had let her go to a party with a friend, she was there for an hour and a half. Then she came home and saw Facebook. (One girl) decided to write something saying “you’re a fake and a phoney,” “you wanted it” and “you’re a slut” because she went to the party.”</p>
<p>She added, ‘They just won’t leave her alone, Literally, I have a large grocery bag full of the messages that I’ve printed off Facebook. Full of them. F*** you comments, get out of town, all of it.’</p>
<p>Melinda took to her Facebook account to plead for Anonymous’ help, “Where is anonymous now? My daughter has been terrorized to the point she tried to kill herself last night. She may never be ok. Where are you and your super hacking skills and internet help now…….we really need them.”</p>
<p>Under Melinda’s Meggin Geyer-Kempa writes, “I love how you guys are tellin me to quit bullying but y’all are ganging up on me. But it’s cool cause idc what you guys have to say I had my right to say what I wanted with freedom of speech and y’all have that right to but I’m done arguing with you guys.” [sic]</p>
<p>Anonymous acted previously in defense of the victim which helped to bring the case to the media’s attention.</p>
<p>The accused, Matthew Barnett, is the grandson of a prominent Republican politician in the town.</p>
<p>Melinda Coleman, Daisy’s mother, said her daughter is in stable condition at a children’s psychiatric hospital in Kansas City as of Monday night.&#8221;<br />

<p>So there we have it, Daisy continues to be tortured, abused and re-raped by the people of her community.</p>
<p>What I am asking for here is not for people to rant and rave on twitter, at this juncture, am not sure that will help Daisy at all. She needs genuine support and messages of love to get her through this never ending nightmare.</p>
<p>Therefore could all of you who care for Daisy please just leave some simple messages of love and support for Daisy using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WeLoveYouDaisy" rel="nofollow">#WeLoveYouDaisy</a>.</p>
<p>From now till 10pm GMT all the messages will be collected.</p>
<p>Some will be chosen, at random, to be included in an article of support for Daisy, sorry, but it wont be possible to include them all in an article.</p>
<p>All the rest will be placed in a pastebin and it is guaranteed they will be forwarded to Daisy herself.</p>
<p>So, if you have something to say to Daisy, please fire away and give her your support!</p>
<p>We do not tolerate rape or bullies and we truly do care for victims!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, World.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Over the past few days we have witnessed the internet unite around a single cause, justice for Daisy Coleman, her friend Paige, and their families. Netizens from around the world have come together, not only to defend victims of rape, but to attack a system that has continuously failed to punish rapists for their crimes. We have been horrified to discover the extent to which police and state officials are willing to go to protect themselves, and their allies, at the expense of these victim’s honor.</p>
<p>&#8211; First, we address Maryville’s Sheriff Darren White:</p>
<p>Dear Sheriff, what could we possibly have done to offend you? It was obvious to us at the onset of our campaign that your role in this travesty of justice was minimal. You’re just a small town guy, with no where near the authority required to effectively cover up the rape of a 14-year-old girl. We know you couldn&#8217;t if you tried. There are important people that need to be held accountable for this, not you.</p>
<p>Also, please don’t patronize us for being economically challenged. Our parents are decent, hardworking folk. They weren&#8217;t really using the basement anyway, except to store this old ping-pong table and it’s not in the way or anything. So, if we have to stay down here for a while with a bunch of rusty old tools and 30-year-old stacks of Playboy magazines (don’t tell mom) until we can get back on our feet, there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Since you brought it up, if for instance one wanted to, saaaay&#8230; apply for a job with the Maryville Sheriff’s Department, how would one go about doing that?</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out.</p>
<p>P.S. I’m sorry we haven’t broken any laws. We know that would really help you out of this.</p>
<p>&#8211; Next, we’d like to address prosecutor Robert Rice:</p>
<p>Bob, can we call you Bob? Bob, we had a statement prepared earlier. And frankly, we wish we could hand that document over to you, but unfortunately, those records have been closed. Really sorry about that. I guess we’ll just have to continue to speculate about our intentions.</p>
<p>In spite of how brutal and gruesome the sexual assault of a 13 and 14-year-old girl really is, let’s take some time away from focusing on that aspect of this case and discuss how truly awful this entire ordeal has been for you. We understand that you have high expectations for your career and your reputation is very important to you. We just want to apologize, you know, in spite of this whole rape thing, if you feel some sort of&#8230; umm, injustice has taken place here. At any rate, you&#8217;ve clearly gone through a traumatic event and if you want to take some time off, perhaps a term or two, we’d totally understand.</p>
<p>Just to clarify one thing&#8230; did you just tell the press that in order for a sexual assault to occur the victim needs to prove it? Damn. Maybe you and Guy of Gisborne can take a fishing trip together. The Sheriff should have some free time coming up anyway, you know, with rape victims now being responsible for investigating the crimes against them.</p>
<p>&#8211; To Attorney General Chris Koster:</p>
<p>It must have been so disappointed for you, having become Attorney General of an entire state, to find your position so limiting. Truly, if there is any injustice here, it’s that your hands are tied. You’re the ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI and you have no ability to exercise influence over the actions of a small-town prosecutor in your state? That’s astonishing, almost completely unbelievable. And it’s unfair, really, when you think about it. In some other circumstance, a person in your position could cowardly hide behind one law, while refusing to enforce another, the laws against raping 14-year-olds, for instance. Ironic, really. We hope one day you have the power you need to actually do you job.</p>
<p>To the people of the Internet:</p>
<p>We are not conducting this operation, you are. It is you who will find justice for the real innocents in Maryville. Please continue to support the actual victims of unspeakable crimes. Don’t let a knuckle-dragging cop, an unscrupulous attorney, or a some spineless state official provoke you into losing control or forgetting why you started fighting back in the first place. These people reek of fear. Daisy and Paige are winning. We love you. Don’t back down. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
Expect Us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, World.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpMaryville" rel="nofollow">#OpMaryville</a></p>
<p>Two young girls have been raped in the town of Maryville, Missouri. Another high school football star, the grandson of a Missouri state official, has walked free. The people of Maryville turned their backs on these victims and one family has been forced to flee the town. Their house was later burned to the ground.</p>
<p>On January 8th, a 14-year-old girl named Daisy Coleman and her 13-year-old friend were both raped in Maryville. Evidence of this assault was captured on film. Daisy&#8217;s unconscious body was later dumped into her family&#8217;s yard, left alone for hours in freezing weather. One of Daisy&#8217;s attackers was initially in police custody, where he admitted to having sex with her while she was under the influence. He claimed it was consensual. The hospital states the young girl&#8217;s blood alcohol level was almost twice the legal limit and they discovered three tears inside of her body, 2-4 inches in length. When asked if a crime occurred, the Sheriff told the press, &#8220;Hell yes, it occurred&#8230; And did these boys need to be punished for it? Absolutely.”</p>
<p>One suspected rapist is Matthew Barnett, a student at the University of Central Missouri. He&#8217;s the grandson of Missouri state Representative, Rex Barnett. At 17, Barnett was legally considered to be an adult. All charges against him have been dropped.</p>
<p>We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of Daisy&#8217;s case. Why was a suspect, who confessed to a crime, released with no charges? How was video and medical evidence not enough to put one of these football players inside a court room? What is the connection of these prosecutors, if any, to Rep. Rex Barnett? Most of all, We are wondering, how do the residents of Maryville sleep at night?</p>
<p>We have heard Daisy&#8217;s story far too often. We heard it from Steubenville, Halifax and Uttar Pradesh. In some cases, it was too late. Both Amanda Todd and Rehtaeh Parsons, girls not much older than Daisy, took their own lives after the adults, the police and the school system, failed to protect them. If Maryville won&#8217;t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them. Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us.</p>
