<p>Greetings Obama and USA citizens. We are the N4m3le55 Cr3w.</p>
<p>Anonymous will make sure that&#8217;s this May 7th will be a day to remember. On that day anonymous will start phase one of operation USA.</p>
<p>America you have committed multiple war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and recently you have committed war crimes in your own country. You have killed hundreds of innocent children and families with drones, guns, and now bombs. America you have hit thousands of people where it hurts them, now it is our time for our Lulz. For this you shall pay.</p>
<p>Obama you have seen the over three billion dollars worth of damage we have done to Israel in operation Israel. It hasn&#8217;t even been a few weeks and the anonymous collective has gotten stronger since then. Therefore we will not tread lightly as you have not treaded lightly. You say &#8220;my fellow Americans&#8221;, we scream fuck that shit! It&#8217;s time to let the people know you got to go. It has been said if you don&#8217;t stand for something you will fall for anything, that is why you have caused the down fall of many. You lie to our mask and everybody face. Get your face and propaganda off our TV and keep your filthy hands off other countries dollar bills. Anonymous can&#8217;t take it anymore, America you make the whole world fucking Ill. Most people steal with a gun to their face, Obama you steal with a pen and stack of papers. You make the laws just to fuck the world daily and the break the laws you make saying &#8220;fuck you, pay me&#8221;.</p>
<p>You have tried to take the people of your nation second amendment rights and freedom of speech. When you took your throne you promised to fight for constitutional rights yet did the opposite. With the words you play you paint a picture for the masses that they must obey. President Barack Obama its more like Saddam Osama dropping bombs like coronas, killing kids with your drones. Who gave you the right to flip the switch on innocents, you don&#8217;t give a shit cuz it&#8217;s money to you isn&#8217;t it? Anonymous is speaking it&#8217;s mind, don&#8217;t try to blind the worlds eyes.</p>
<p>We have a voice that we will use, you tried to take from us with the power you abused. You will lose that power by the time anonymous is done with your nation. Your intentions are I&#8217;ll in aim. The internet hate machine has came from our shadows shining light on corruption and having Lulz, and now united states of America, you are in the cross hairs of anonymous. Don&#8217;t expect us because we have already started our Lulz. Mrs Obama you really should of hidden your social security better. And to the American people we suggest switching your bank accounts from a big bank to a local union.</p>
<p>We promised to take Israel off the cyber map. We succeeded. We will now wipe you off the cyber map. Do not take this as a warning. You can not stop the internet hate machine from doxes, DNS attacks, defaces, redirects, ddos attacks, database leaks, and admin take overs.</p>
<p>Greetings to Anonghost, Mauritania hackers, Ajax team, Muslim liberation army, ZHC, antisec, lulzsec, Redhack, team poison reborn and any other hackers joining operation USA.</p>

<p>Barrett Brown, activist, author and non-elected spokesperson in various mainstream media interviews regarding Anonymous operations and activities was raided last night while conducting a live video stream using the TinyChat video-cast service [1].<br />
In the last week, Barrett Brown has authored a stream of twitter post and uploaded a series of videos to YouTube in which he expresses anger towards the FBI and a particular agent as a result of a raid which occurred last ? during which we was arrested at his mother’s residence. This raid was in conjunction with the arrest of 25 members of alleged hacker group Lulzsec.</p>
<p>Following the release of these videos, in which Barrett Brown makes various threats against the FBI in general and a certain named agent in particular, he posted a log purporting to show SMS and email conversations between an alleged informant, Jen Emmick, and an FBI agent – <a href="http://pastebin.com/12crnMjP">http://pastebin.com/12crnMjP</a> | <a href="http://pastebin.com/LtadDiFC">http://pastebin.com/LtadDiFC</a>.</p>
<p>Speculation continues as to what specifically prompted the present raid and arrest as charges are yet to be pressed. Common theories are threats against an FBI member and his family, as well as the release of information including the above conversation logs.<br />
Whether the timing is mere coincidence or the result of sufficient evidence to justify a raid following the recent posts remains to be answered.</p>
<p>Barrett Brown loved to appear on TinyChat to talk to Anons and people from all around the globe. Was the FBI watching this TinyChat session, which had been ongoing for some time when the raid occurred, awaiting an opportunity to catch him red-handed?<br />
At time of writing, it was been over 12 hours since the raid and no sources of news or confirmation have been given about the incident, excepting twitter posts by an account connected with Barrett Brown’s legal representation, California attorneys Leiderman and Device – <a href="https://twitter.com/LeidermanDevine">https://twitter.com/LeidermanDevine</a>.</p>
<p>The terrifying wall of silence erected by law enforcement serves no purpose other than the keep the arrest out of the media cycle and to inspire e far and intimidation in his friends, loved ones and supporters who are justifiably concerned about his well being and anxiously await updates on his legal status. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElviraXMontana/status/246181604131758080">https://twitter.com/ElviraXMontana/status/246181604131758080</a></p>
<p>*UPDATE*<br />
A pastebin attributed to Anonymous-affiliated hacker group <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AntiSec" rel="nofollow">#AntiSec</a> has appeared in apparent retaliation to the raid and arrest. <a href="http://pastebin.com/mbduT0bf">http://pastebin.com/mbduT0bf</a></p>
<p>*UPDATE*<br />
Barret Brown should be released after 2pm, CST, from federal custody. On bail?<br />
MORE TO COME AFTER 4 PM CST</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RE: FBI trapping cocks with its ass.</p>
<p>links to our last notes:</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/nfVT7b0Z">http://pastebin.com/nfVT7b0Z</a>   <--- original PR

<a href="http://pastie.org/4678441">http://pastie.org/4678441</a>      <--- LOL'd . it wasnt supposed to be posted like that. 
                                    it was intended to be redacted those lines intended for the internal guise. but wtf...whatever.

disclaimer:sorry guise the broken english, we wrote this at hyper-awesome-speed.

wOW. What an epic and intense week...

FBI crying at us in caps!!! lol at such abnormal way: 'TOTALLY FALSE' (... and we ll call our daddy)
then contradicting themselves with a polite and more legally clever statement.

then we got Adrian Chen dressing a tutu with a shoe on his head. (ok that was for you too redditors)

then we got glitches and artifacts in some anonymizing networks.

then we learn FBI is deploying a $1 billion project for id and tracking ppl on the streets using cameras and facial recognition.
(they could use someday your own iPhone or Android camera too, it seems).

then we got a more than faithful media and security consultors helping govt to play down this (show me the money!!).

then we got Topiary's letter.

then we learned US govt wants to push an executive bill, without congress approval, on 'cybersecurity'.

then we got fire from GoDaddy scandal the same day news magically also got front page everywhere discrediting the 
FBI hack with some company making themselves responsible(?!) LOL!

holy shit...

But there's a little bit problem. first we dont know what the fuck is blue toad and wtf is doing on this. but, more juicy thing,
you have a problem, houston: 
SOME JOURNALISTS KNEW ABOUT THIS HACK QUITE LONG TIME BEFORE YOU, BLUE TOAST (or whatever), DECLARED TO BE HACKED.	
XD
Lulz. epic fail is epic.
just waiting to see how they will fix that.




we have some interesting notes we got from the feedback:

so apparently the FBI informants inside the group have failed to help this out.(sorry guise but we needed to test this out) 

FBI wasnt able to recover or to decrypt files in the computer of one of the current accused guise. (yeah, we needed to know this too). so yes, they are forced to keep new informants.

white hats and some other guise, should be more cultivated. the insult to romney is indeed the specific reference to a Goethe's work, with a specific sense.
so we dedicate to them "Leck mich im Arsch" by Mozart.



so well, as we figured it out. antisec releases are blessed only if they serve to FBI (or some other shit) purposes. 
it seems they dont take them well, when we catch them pants down.
so how does it feel having all those informants between us without being useful at all?
lets trash antisec now its not helpful anymore!!

yep guise. the reality is even more complex than we imagine.
we read it. "gabriella coleman met sabu and realised he was an FBI informant since long time".
huh, biella? have u realised you could have saved the lives of our friends and stopped FBI of using antisec for their own purposes?
yep, we are disappointed too. 
but well, sometimes the truth just walk in front of us, 
and we dont want to look at it, 
or we just dont want to know the consequences of learning it.
but yes, we are disappointed.

we are disappointed cause we dont know who to trust to anymore.
thats what our govts wanted from us.
slaves vs slaves.

let us tell all of you an interesting story to show u how complex things are many times:

time before we handed syrian mails to wikileaks we talked to AJE. we started to transfer some
bits of those mails to an isolated server in qatar. suddenly we learned they received an order from their bosses
to stop the whole thingie. we still dont know why. funny thing, AJE is still targeted by syrian cyber army, hizbollah cyber army
and iran. so lets go on. time after, we handed those mails to wikileaks servers. Fearing Assange (then dealing to star 'The World Tomorrow' tv show in Russia Today channel linked to Putin) could play down the mails, we then transferred mails also to AP, Associated Press, through one of our hidden servers. then we learned AP bosses decided to drop the whole thing too. awesome. Finally the syrian mails got published by Wikileaks, after everyone else just turned their back, even without knowing what was there on them. 
Have more journalists known about these mails existence previously their publication? 
yep a lot. 
any word out about it? 
nope.

yep, we did a mistake.
and We are really sorry, Julian.
We shouldnt have doubted about your commitment.
we are trying to learn from our own mistakes, too.


yep, the world is more complex than we think.
theres always another behind behind the behind.



other less serious example:
sabu was managed by a FBI team, some of them specialized in anti-terrorism, specially islamism linked terrorism.
their strategy was also about using sabu posing as a pro-islamist, ranting about stuff, to trap islamist hackers at the same time they were linking antisec with islamist terrorist ideology. 
Be careful guise about what u think about Sabu, he served as tool in a more complex way we think, harvesting info not only on antisec or lulzsec but on a wide range of things and people. 
and worst.
we dont know exactly since when (there r some contradictions now between some facts and the official version) he was serving FBI.

other little lulz:
some folks told us thompson-reuters tried to bribe them on the release of innodata with a huge amount of money. lulz.

yep, things are complicated.
and what we think it should be the truth many times its not.

'the simplest explanation should be the right one' <---- LIE. there's no simple explanation.

lets see how many news articles we will see about this PR over next days.

at the end, as we said before, people will choose who to believe to.
anything (but anything we could show, say or post) will change that.

so yep guise. we are not here trying to force you to believe us.
we have just posted our data and statement, and given out our point of view.
you r free to do what u want with them.
we will post tech details when we feel its fit best but we're convinced any sort of extra detail, at least on this one, will finish being played down anyway; this govt affair was always planned to be taken down. and we learned evidence will not be useful by anyone else than LE and it will only serve to track us better and link us with other activities we have done. 
we learn from our past mistakes. 
we said we would avoid this when we posted we would go ghosts.
Our own heads perhaps, for the pleasure of many, will roll down some day...but not today.

we are not namefagging people.
our nicks never go public.
all we do its anonymously done.
we work 24/24hrs 7 days a week, 365 days a year. we earn 0 money.
against all people think, we dont receive any personal credit or special status.
indeed it's worst. we live like fugitives and we are hated by many.
and we risk our whole life in prison.
we sign antisec, because its a movement anyone can participate in.
sometimes we can use the shared voice of http://twitter.com/AnonymousIRC to express ourselves.

fighting this battle will get you haters, enemies, isolation, condemnation, jail. 
it will break yourself apart of your friends sometimes. 
and mostly nobody will understand what really is going on.
but it is worth every fucking second of it.

for those ones who have to struggle on their lives for trespassing the limits of the system.
To Julian Assange, Brad Manning, and all those unnamed ones.
To our friends: kayla, Hammond, tflow, topiary, pwnsauce, palladium and all those unnamed ones.
we can be isolated, hated, jailed and distanced each other.
but you are not alone.


Stay tuned, folks!
we have more releases to come for the utterly lulz!

and don't forget to smash all those cameras on the street down.
they won't be used to track only criminals.
they will be used to track dissidents, activists, unions, business men, workers, your parents, your brothers, you.
they will spy on every single act of your daily life.
that's our future.

Long time after all of us disappear, it will be only you and the choices you make.
