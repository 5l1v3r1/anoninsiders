The people of China have been denied access to the internet, effectively silencing them.<br />
This leaves them unable to speak out about any injustice or corruption in their country.<br />
The Chinese government has tried to isolate its citizens, and for that they will pay.<br />

<p>This week marks an important anniversary in the history of pro freedom activism. Unfortunately if you live in the country where this event took place it’s very likely you have no knowledge of it even though it’s taught history and political classes across the world. If you do happen to know about this event you certainly don’t openly talk about it in a public setting.</p>
<p>The event I’m referring to is the Tiananmen Square riots that took place in Beijing China on June 4th 1989. The admirable amount of courage activists showed during this historic uprising has helped lead to many positive changes in one of the most populous nations in the world. After the riots China started opening it’s doors to the rest of the world and millions of Chinese citizens have benefited from a booming economy and are now able to experience the pleasures of a growing middle and upper class lifestyle.</p>
<p>However, many things have stayed the same in China and have even become worse in certain areas. The Chinese government loves to roll out press releases boasting about being home to the most internet users in the world, but they always conveniently fail to mention that China is also home to some of the harshest internet censorship policies in the world.</p>
<p>In recent months the government has been stepping up it’s censorship efforts due to recent political scandals, activists fleeing to other countries for safety, and in anticipation for Beijing’s once in a decade change in political leadership (without the citizens voting on who their leaders will be, of course). Websites have been shut down, bloggers and regulars citizens have been arrested and gone missing, and China’s largest social media networks have made sweeping policy changes making it harder and harder for people to share their real views on the internet and especially harder to do it with full anonymity. Just this week even trying to do a simple search such as “Shanghai stock market” resulted in blank page results simply because at one point the stock market had dropped 64.89 points, the same date as the Tiananmen square massacre 23 years ago.</p>
<p>Anonymous has taken notice of the denial of basic freedoms the Chinese government allows it’s citizens to have, and we have taken notice of it’s attempts to close down anything close to resembling a free and open internet where ideas and opinions can be exchanged.</p>
<p>Starting in March Anonymous has started launching campaigns and attacks both on the internet and within China. Hundreds of Chinese government and business sites have been compromised and we intend even larger events to happen in the coming months. As the government prepares to change power in the coming months without the input of Chinese citizens, Anonymous is also preparing in our own way.</p>
<p>We would like to take this moment to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and to remember previous activists who lied their life on the line, current activists who lay their life on the line, and all the future activists that will continue to join is in the future.</p>
<p>Dear China,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous</p>
<p>We do not forget</p>
<p>We do not forgive</p>
<p>Expect Us</p>
