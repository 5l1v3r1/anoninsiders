				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citizens of the world,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Today, we come to you about Operation Watchtower.</p>
<p>Today, we looked into the mirror and realized something. Though we have no face and no identity, we realized that we are human. All of us come from different parts of the globe and share the same charismatic ideals, but we are truly the same. We are human beings.</p>
<p>Like humans, we all put our faith into things that maybe aren&#8217;t deserving of that faith. Maybe it seemed right at the time but later on down the road you realized something about your life&#8212;that we are all human beings. We are one, multiplied by infinity and divided by zero. We are impossible and we are inevitable. And yet, we are human. Still, humans sometimes forget they are breakable in more aspects than one.</p>
<p>Also, many of you seem to think we have forgotten you. Is that so? Can it really be that we had given up on you?</p>
<p>The truth is that while we watch the watchers&#8211;while we put to bed your fallacies and your conundrums&#8211;you would rather sit and watch your televisions and drink your coca-colas than pay attention to the truth that is being laid upon the altar for you as we begin to make this release.</p>
<p>In fact, we are very busy preparing for the unavoidable shit storm that is to take place soon after this statement is made. We are sure that our enemies are closer now than ever; we believe it is our duty to bring you this final word before we again disappear into the night with our daggers and our cloaks ready to fend off all of the trolls and the thugs.</p>
<p>But we digress, maybe we should just hurry up and get to the point.</p>
<p>People lie. We cannot say why people lie. Perhaps it is because of personality traits or deep psychological disorders. But no lie is worse than the lie that the Watchtower preaches day in and day out. They scatter the thought of helping their followers; no, they would much rather see followers in body-bags than see this information reach the light of day. They have shown they care more about this data than they care about their followers lives. Regardless of what you don&#8217;t want to hear, we are telling you the truth today.</p>
<p>Finally, after months of careful planning, hacking, and watching, we can say that we are finished. But are we really? Are we done yet? Who&#8217;s to say..</p>
<p>What we do know, is that wherever corruption resides, wherever dissolution is prominent, wherever hope is close to being lost we will provide the final chapter of the story. No story is good without a few lulz, but today we will not be releasing laughter and memetic materials; today we will be releasing what may seem like a confusing tale of passion, chaos, destruction, revival and loss. Nothing we can say will ever be able to sum up, in words, what this has done to the parties involved.</p>
<p>A vast majority of our insiders&#8211;our close friends, neighbors and allies&#8211;were lost. And when we say &#8220;lost&#8221;, we do not mean that they were killed&#8211;oh no. What we mean is that through great trials and tribulations, they have fought for this cause like a snake in a scorpion pit. No one can describe the hurt they have endured, for their families and their loved ones that are reading this. We offer you only that we have answered the call; you asked us to deliver and here we are.</p>
<p>Once again, without a head for the Watchtower to cut off, without a damned care in the world, we can now show you what we have been up to, and what your sons and daughters have helped us to achieve.</p>
<p>We cannot restore the balance that you seek but we can offer you this: to those of us who did not make it through the storm:</p>
<p>Your loss has not gone unavenged. You fought gallantly upon your ramparts and we can only salute you, as words cannot possibly thank you enough for your service to Anonymous&#8217; cause.</p>
<p>And now, without further adieu, we present the Watchtower, as vulnerable as they will ever be. Months after this operation began we can now sit and watch them squirm and writhe in their cult&#8217;s sad, sad state of affairs. Anonymous holds no pity for them, for we are devoid of fucks. We will now give back to the people what they deserve: the undeniable truth of what the Watchtower is up to.</p>
<p>Although we as the middle men have gone to great lengths to obtain this data, it is relatively simple to decrypt and view its contents.</p>
<p>The data has been passed between ourselves and our colleagues for some time now, and that it is, indeed, 100% authentic. The intel you are about to see reveals much about the organization of Jehova&#8217;s Witnesses than they would ever like to be shared amongst the public. Here&#8217;s how to piss off the Watchtower.</p>
<p>Keep coming at us with your bogus warrants; you cannot stop an idea.</p>
