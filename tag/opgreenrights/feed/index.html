<p>Leak obtains by Anonymous Operatin Green Rights&#8217; team prove that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochovce_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant</a> in Solvakia is unsafe and does not met many of the minimun safety requirements.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a part of their statement that explain how some workers knew the plant was unsafe.</p>
<blockquote><p> An email [2], dated 31th march 2013  from the STF documentation, was sent by an STF member to others. It says that &#8220;by an ispection completed in Mochovce yard we know that the inspector who performed the inspection did not manage the process quality and documentation in a proper way&#8221;, but &#8220;actually this documentation was conformed, altough many reported  &#8220;incongruities&#8221;, however &#8220;the inspection were not done&#8221;. So we claim that reactors 3 and 4 in Mochovce nuclear plan where builded without any supervision.  We underline: there were &#8220;many reported incongruities&#8221; from the project. These &#8220;incongruities&#8221; are differences between the reactors&#8217; projects and the actuallyto be poorly carried out labouring/manufacturing during the reactor construction. Moreover, the documentation for ENEL was, according to the email, &#8220;conformed&#8221; i.e. problems and/or anomalies were excluded/manipulated to produce satisfactory datasets. As the author of the email underlines, &#8220;the situation is more serious as we consider that we were talking about components of a nuclear power plant&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anonymous began as an idea, an idea that unites the people of the world in the struggle for human rights and freedom. The same ideals that led to the birth of this new faction of Anonymous.</p>
<p>Operation Green Rights is a summary of our frustration at seeing the human race enslaved god&#8217;s money, for which commits murder, exploit and oppress people and goes against the principles of democracy and human respect that should be the basis of any modern civilized country. We have seen wars carried out for the black gold, subject peoples dictatorships convenient for trade agreements, billions spent on research and nuclear war and cut funding for research on renewable energy and oil tankers sunk that cause planetary damage.</p>
<p>In addition, global warming, caused by these policies, it is a reality that we must be aware. The glaciers are melting, tides rise, the ozone hole is growing, the climate changes, changing climatic conditions, animal species become extinct ..</p>
<p>The current global policies of many large corporations and many governments are trampling on our rights and those of every other living being, only in exchange for money. We at Operation Green Rights say stop about this!</p>
<p>Operation Green Rights wants for our children a life in a civilized world that welcomes them with open arms and show respect for life and nature itself. We want that Mother Earth will continue to live healthy and promoting life with its beauty. We want the exploitation of peoples and the blood spilled in the streets no longer in the name of greed.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us.</p>
