<p>To The People Of The World,</p>
<p>Greetings From Anonymous.</p>
<p>On the 25th Of January the citizens of Egypt once again took to the streets in record numbers to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the Egyptian uprising that resulted in the overthrow of the Mubarak dictatorship and to voice their anger and discontent with the current regime being led by the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>Morsi&#8217;s regime had completely failed in their promise to deliver democracy to the people of Egypt and the same corruption, brutality, lack of democratic freedoms and widespread human rights abuses that existed during the Mubarak era still continues under Muslim Brotherhood rule.</p>
<p>In true dictator style, Morsi unleashed his brutal thugs from the security forces as well as armed plainclothed Muslim Brotherhood members and rifle-toting snipers on the huge numbers of unarmed peaceful protesters who had gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo, outside the presidential palace in Cairo and in many other locations across Egypt.</p>
<p>Anonymous watched in absolute horror as our Egyptian brothers and sisters were literally being shot, stabbed, beaten, tear-gassed, dragged away to detention centers and even sexually assaulted by Morsi&#8217;s thugs &#8211; many protesters were killed, some who were killed were not even taking part in any protests. The killing and the brutality that took place was no different than what took place under the Mubarak regime, if anything it was a continuation, so much for Morsi and his promises of democracy for all Egyptians!</p>
<p>Anonymous could not sit back and idly watch as our brothers and sisters in Egypt were facing such shocking, savage &amp; inhumane treatment for the so-called &#8216;crime&#8217; of gathering in the streets to peacefully demand basic democratic rights. We decided to act in solidarity with the people of Egypt by banding together many dedicated Anons from all corners of the globe and and co-ordinating some electronic civil disobedience!</p>
<p>For the period covering the 30th of January 2013 to the 2nd of February, Anonymous : <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpEgypt" rel="nofollow">#OpEgypt</a> claim full responsibility for the electronic civil disobedience actions via Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attacks on the following Egyptian government &amp; Muslim Brotherhood related websites&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">English-language website for the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior</a> (at the time of writing of this press release (Feb 03 2013), this site is still not available worldwide)</li>
<li><a href=" http://www.ikhwanismailia.com/">A Muslim Brotherhood propaganda website</a>, which was forced offline for over half an hour.</li>
<li><a href=" http://www.moinfo.gov.eg/">Egyptian Ministry of Information</a> website, which was forced offline for over half an hour.</li>
<li><a href=" http://www.mcit.gov.eg/">Egyptian Ministry Of Communications &amp; Technology</a> website, which was also forced offline for over half an hour.</li>
<li><a href=" http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/">Egypt’s Cabinet</a> website.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For screengrabs that document these actions please check the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/416288781778708/">Facebook event page</a> and in particular the following photo album that can be found on the event page where you will also find many <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.197867047025087&amp;type=1">graphic presentations relevant to the operation</a></strong></p>
<p>As this press release is being written, the protests in Egypt are continuing, as is the violent &amp; barbaric crackdown by Morsi&#8217;s security forces. The regime is now attempting to disrupt unity among the protesters by demonizing certain groups of protesters by labelling them as &#8216;terrorist groups&#8217;, particularly groups such as the Black Bloc who were brave enough to physically protect citizens under attack from the security forces and to physically resist the vicious attacks from Morsi&#8217;s thugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/QyLnGHJg4K4">Shocking video footage</a> has also emerged from the past few days showing the horrendous violence that protestors are now facing at the hands of the security forces, this is just one of many but please be warned, this footage is quite confronting&#8230;</p>
<p>This phase of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpEgypt" rel="nofollow">#OpEgypt</a> is fully operational at this stage until the 28th of February, but if the situation in Egypt continues at it&#8217;s present rate, then you can definitely EXPECT US to continue!!</p>

<p>Dear citizens of the world,</p>
<p>Anonymous can not, and will not stand idly while people are being denied their basic rights and human liberties. Yet, there are still a lot of governments worldwide who fail to even aspire to the standard of freedom that was set by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These governments believe they have the right and privilege to impose upon their own people an &#8216;official&#8217; version of &#8216;reality&#8217; which isn&#8217;t in any way tampered by the truths of everyday life under which its citizens are living. Anonymous believes this is an outright crime which can not go unpunished.</p>
<p>The Egyptian people are living under inhumane conditions; being denied their basic rights to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and the free access to information. By imposing censorship upon its own people and condemning these freedoms, the Egyptian government has revealed itself to be criminal, and has made itself an enemy of Anonymous.</p>
<p>To the Egyptian Government: Anonymous challenges all those who are involved in censorship. Anonymous wants you to offer free access to uncensored media in your entire country. When you ignore this message, not only will we attack your government websites, Anonymous will also make sure that the international media sees the horrid reality you impose upon your people. Anonymous will not spare anybody who supports this suppression. It is in the hands of the Egyptian government to end this: continue your repression and you will be subject to civil protest &#8211; lend an ear to the claim of freedom from your people and the hostilities will cease.</p>
<p>To the Egyptian people: We stand together and united against this oppression. This struggle is not just for you alone, but for the whole of humankind. Citizens can no longer endure their governments abuse. When forced by the threat of oppression, we will be loud as hell &#8211; and when the people roar, it will send shivers down the spines of all those who stifle our freedom and take our precious liberties away.</p>
<p>Anonymous are your brothers and sisters, your sons and daughters, your parents and your friends, regardless of age, gender, race, religion, ethnicity, or place of birth. Anonymous is you. You will not be denied your right to free speech, free press, free association and your universal right to freely access information, both in real life and through the internet.</p>
<p>Join us on the IRC &#8211; irc.anonops.ru <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opEgypt" rel="nofollow">#opEgypt</a> !</p>
<p>Join us in this battle for freedom of information worldwide!</p>
<p>For as Khalil Gibran once said: &#8220;Life without Freedom is like a body without a soul, and Freedom without Thought is like a confused spirit&#8230; Life, Freedom and Thought are three-in-one, and are everlasting and shall never pass away.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear citizens of the world,</p>
<p>Anonymous can not, and will not stand idly while people are being denied their basic rights and human liberties. The people of Egypt have shown to the world the power of their struggle. Indeed they could force the ex-president, Mubarak, to step aside, and also force the ruling generals to conduct the sought elections, yielding the current president of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Morsi. However, Dr. Morsi has repeatedly shown how lack of care about the core values of democracy. Through elections he has reached to power because the people had to choose between him and the old regime. But now, Dr. Morsi is gradually grasping more and more authoritarian powers in his hands, attacking the whole concept of democracy. His latest constitutional declaration has given him the powers of a pharaoh and appointing him as the new God of Egypt.</p>
<p>The people of Egypt have been demanding: Bread [livelihood], Freedom, Social Justice, and Human Dignity. However those demands are less and less achievable under such circumstances.</p>
<p>To Dr. Morsi: Anonymous will not sit by and watch you washing away what thousands of Egyptians got killed and injured for. It’s your duty to listen to your own people. The decisions you made have cause the death of 2 young Egyptians in addition to hundreds more injured. In addition, your organized propaganda is portraying your legitimate opposition as if they are opposing the revolution, which you are destroying. We challenge your propaganda machine. When you ignore this message, not only will we attack your organization’s websites, Anonymous will also make sure that you stand exposed against your people as well as the international community. Anonymous will not spare anybody who supports such crimes. It’s in your hands to stop this: continue hardening your head and you will be subject to civil protest – lend an ear to the claim of freedom from your people and the hostilities will cease.</p>
<p>It is our duty to show our solidarity to the people of Egypt now, as we all did two years ago.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us.</p>
