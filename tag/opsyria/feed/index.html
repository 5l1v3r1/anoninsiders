<p><iframe width="620" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFO6EWTMdpo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Anonymous, our <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Anonymous-to-Launch-TYLER-WikiLeaks-on-Steroids-267533.shtml">humanity</a> is lost.</h2>
<p>The United States government is openly creating <a href="http://www.infowars.com/syria-ripe-for-a-false-flag/">terrorism</a> alongside NATO and Israel to demonize the Syrian Arab Republic. Terrorism has no bias and will not hesitate to use any means to kill.</p>
<p>Mainstream media prostitutes are spreading false claims stating that the &#8220;Syrian government&#8221; is planning attacks using biological weapons against its own people.</p>
<h2>The <a href="https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7mxtwAjMN1r4aqkho1_500.jpg">truth</a> is</h2>
<p>the United States government, along with its western allies, is facilitating this war by supplying terrorist cells with weapons to destabilize the Syrian government, then using the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221; as justification in an attempt to invade Syria&#8217;s territory; all of this so as to implement policies of their own and rape the country of its resources.</p>
<p>Currently, terror gangs supported by the &#8220;Central Intelligence Agency&#8221; (CIA) and other western powers have been supplied with Biological chemicals called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin">Sarin gas</a> &#8212; aka GB nerve gas &#8212; considered a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Sarin or GB is a colorless, odorless liquid, used as a chemical weapon owing to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. It has been classified as a deadly weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations according to <a href="https://www.fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0687.htm">Resolution 687</a>. Production and stockpiling of Sarin was outlawed by the  <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsp/chemical.html">Chemical Weapons Convention &#8211; 1993</a>.</p>
<p>The Biological chemicals came from a Turkish chemical manufacturer named &#8220;<a href="http://www.tekkimlab.com/">Tekkim Laboratories</a>&#8220;. A video that depicts what appears to be terrorist rebels shows the biological chemicals and demonstrates its uses against two rabbits, ultimately exterminating them within less then a minute.</p>
<p>The man in the video says: &#8220;You saw what happened. This will be your fate, you infidel Alawites, I swear by Allah to make you die like these rabbits, only a minute after you inhale the gas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sibel Deniz Edmonds, founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We started reporting on the preparation by US and NATO and their Turkish partners in southern Turkey starting in May 2011. You are looking at sixteen or seventeen months ago, the United States &#8212; with their base in Turkey &#8212; started preparations for [the] war against Syria.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Obama has stated, &#8220;Today I want to make it absolutely clear to Assad and those under his command &#8212; the world is watching. The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. If you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons there will be consequences and you will be held accountable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama and his administration has reached a new low in United states history. It is our duty as Anonymous to make sure that these monsters in power are exposed for who and what they really are. Anonymous must stand up for all those who fall victim to these western powers and its United States terrorist program.</p>
<p>May God protect Syria. its army. its leadership. and people.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to stop terrorism, stop participating in it.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://socialistworker.org/2002-2/433/433_13_Chomsky.shtml">Noam Chomsky</a></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Restoration of the Internet in Syria at 14:32:10 UTC</strong></em></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s time for an update on the struggle in Syria.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the internet was operating countrywide, however after a bit of waiting, it has been revealed the PBX landlines, along with mobile lines, satellite and other communications are back up. What started as a downhill battle quickly turned into a very direct attack on the government of Syria. After three days the lines in Syria have begun to return to normal, but there is some level of network congestion associated with this rise in usage of the internet by so many people at once.</p>
<p>It has also been discovered that TOR, aka the internet activist&#8217;s best weapon, is also working in Syrian provinces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-linked violence-monitoring organization, said &#8220;connectivity had returned to most provinces.&#8221; However it is unclear whether i2p is up and working, though this will soon be confirmed or denied.</p>
<p>We will provide as much coverage on this as the time goes by, but rest assured, the People of the internet are very glad to have their Syrian friends and fellow activists back online at this time.</p>
<p>The red, white, and black flag of Syria waves stronger now than ever in the winds of freedom. It is a great day for activism and a great day for the world entirely, knowing that Syrian people can now return to the internet as usual.</p>
<p>It is important to notice that the current Operation: Syria, which is currently targeting Syrian government and embassies in the country, is still very much ongoing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings World &#8212;</p>
<p>Today, at precisely 10:30 AM ET all Internet traffic into and out of Syria ceased. Within a half hour of this sudden shut down, the PBX land-lines were degraded by 90% and Mobile connectivity was degraded by 75%. The nation of Syria has gone dark. And Anonymous knows all to well what happens in the dark places.</p>
<p><a href="http://localleaks.me/plf/images/SyriaInternet.png">Link http://localleaks.me/plf/images/SyriaInternet.png</a></p>
<p>Anonymous has done an exhaustive analysis of the Internet shut-down in Syria and we have concluded that the Syrian regime has physically severed the fiber-optic and coaxial cables coming into Syria. Essentially, they have physically &#8220;pulled the plug out of the wall&#8221;. As we discovered in Egypt, where the dictator Mubarak did something similar &#8211; this is not damage that can be easily or quickly repaired.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Anonymous has been working with Syrian activists for well over a year in anticipation of this moment. We produced and disseminated the Syrian Care Package &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/Wxx0ev">http://bit.ly/Wxx0ev</a><br />
 and there are emergency independent media centers already set up in every city of Syria. Activists and independent journalists in Syria will be able to utilize these media centers to get news and media out of Syria, and Anonymous will assist in propagating that media to the world. Anonymous will keep open the lines of telecommunication with the free Syrian people. We will be the voice of the voiceless in Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your government shuts down the Internet, shut down your government.&#8221; ~~ Anonymous Egypt</p>
<p>Anonymous will NOT allow this massive violation of the human rights of the free Syrian people go un-punished. We feel this is a desperate move by a dying regime, one that has slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent civilians. Beginning at 9:00 PM ET USA Anonymous will begin removing from the Internet all web assets belonging to the Assad regime that are NOT hosted in Syria. We will begin with the websites and servers belonging to ALL Syrian Embassies abroad, which we will begin systematically removing from the Internet tonight. Our first target will be the website of the Syrian Embassy of in China: syria.org.cn &#8211; we encourage the media to follow the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OpSyriaIRC" rel="nofollow">&commat;OpSyriaIRC</a> for announcements on take-downs, defacements, data dumps, E-Mail bombs and black fax attacks. By turning off the Internet in Syria, the butcher Assad has shown that the time has come for Anonymous to remove the last vestiges of his evil government from the Internet. Soon, his people will remove him from this world. Let the final battle for a free Syria begin&#8230;.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous<br />
We Are Legion<br />
We Do Not Forgive<br />
We Do Not Forget<br />
Bashar Assad, your turn has come &#8211; EXPECT US</p>
