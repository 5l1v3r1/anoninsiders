				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The so called Westboro Baptist Church is not actually a church at all. Rather, it is a small but well funded and highly organized hate group. It&#8217;s core leadership and membership consists of a single family, the Phelps. They specialize in picketing funerals and spewing there unique and disgusting brand of hate, disturbing grieving family members and the public in their time of loss. Over the past approximately five years, Anonymous has confronted them several times, both online and on the ground &#8211; over their announced plan to picket certain funerals. In each and every case our combined cyber and ground operations were enough to cause the WBC to cancel their plans to picket entirely. In addition, these Anonymous campaigns have decimated the membership ranks of the Westboro Baptist Church, and cost them tens of thousands of dollars in damages to their cyber infrastructure. But this can never be taken for granted. And so when the Westboro Baptist Church recently announced their plans to picket at least some of the upcoming funerals in South Carolina for the &#8220;Charleston 9&#8221;, Anonymous once again moved into action.</p>
<p><img src="http://anoninsiders.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sign-gotohell.png" alt="sign-gotohell" width="400" height="672" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3068" /></p>
<p>Over the last several confrontations between Anonymous and the Westboro Baptist Church, we have developed a fairly refined strategy. Our approach will be two pronged. The WBC maintains a rather large cyber infrastructure, and we will destroy this entirely by various means. On the ground, Anonymous will deploy operatives who will initiate our Standard Operating Procedure for dealing with funeral pickets by the Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/cQnF6Rps">SOP For Confronting WBC On The Ground</a></p>
<p>This sustained campaign against the Westboro Baptist Church will continue until all the funerals in Charleston, South Carolina are finished. Anonymous calls upon all Anons, allied crews, hacktivists &#8211; and supporters worldwide to join with us in attacking every known cyber asset of the WBC. Details on the targets can be found on the Op website. Tweet your successes with the hahstag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpShutDownWBC" rel="nofollow">#OpShutDownWBC</a> and mention the primary Op Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OpFerguson" rel="nofollow">&commat;OpFerguson</a> so we can track the damage done to these morons.</p>
<p>Anons and supporters who live in South Carolina, or who are planning on traveling there for the funerals &#8211; we encourage you to prepare to utilize our SOP For Confronting WBC On The Ground linked above. Network together, rehearse scenarios with the SOP. While it is doubtful these idiots will show up, it is critical that Anonymous have a well prepared presence on the ground in Charleston, SC.</p>
<p>To the grieving people of Charleston, South Carolina: we ask that you put these hateful people from your mind entirely. Anonymous has this for you. We know how to deal with these animals, and we will do so. Forget them. Let us handle this for you as our gift of condolence for your unspeakable loss.</p>
<p>Finally, to the members of the Westboro Baptist Church: We are coming for you. We will defeat you just as we always have. Your best bet is to stop this foolishness at once. We know you will not, so you can fucking&#8230;.</p>
<p>EXPECT US</p>
<p>SIGNED  &#8212;  Anonymous</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from Anonymous,</p>
<p>The Westboro Baptist Church announced plans to picket a memorial service taking place in New York City for Aaron Swartz. Operation Angel has moved into a new phase of our operation and we&#8217;re giving the WBC as much attention as they deserve: <strong>none</strong>. We encourage Anonymous to attend the memorial service and show their support to the growing number of people who believe in Aaron&#8217;s legacy. However, our primary responsibility is to protect that legacy by ensuring the ideas he lived for are used to put an end to the malicious prosecution of online activists. We will remain focused and not compromise this mission by surrendering our vision of justice for the opportunity to patronize a small hate group.</p>
<p>Please show your support for Aaron Swartz by attending a protest on the 25th of January at the following locations:</p>
<p>Boston, MA &#8212; The John Joseph Moakley Courthouse, Address: 1 Courthouse Way, Boston, MA. Time: 3pm EST.</p>
<p>Washington D.C. &#8212; Address: 600 Pennsylvania Ave. Time: 3pm EST</p>
<p>Other Updates:</p>
<p>Due to the verified existence of law enforcement surveillance, the hacktivist team that had previously dedicated themselves to digital protests against the Department of Justice on behalf of Aaron Swartz will not complete their demonstration. The names of the hactivist group and law enforcement agency are not being released. There are many others who have already used the internet to show support by compromising MIT&#8217;s networks and releasing documents from JSTOR&#8217;s servers, the very crime Aaron was accused of. Independent actions such as these are likely to continue and we commend the bravery of the groups involved.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

<p>Greetings citizens of the world,</p>
<p>Last week the small town of Newtown, Connecticut witnessed a horrific tragedy; complete with heart wrenching images that will forever be embedded in our minds. As the holidays are coming around the corner, many families and friends will still be in a devastated state of mind. No one wishes to lose a loved one and especially their kid(s).</p>
<p>We thought the same until the Westboro Baptist Church stated its intent to picket the scheduled funerals of the slayed victims of Sandy Hook. The Westboro Baptist Church is made up of 40 members and all of which praise and thank “GOD” for the devastating actions and horrid behaviors that occur.</p>
<p>Ask yourselves, WBC, what if “your” kids were the victims of a rampage that killed 28 innocent vibrant individuals? Would you still be stating that “GOD sent the shooter” and picketing the funeral? We didn’t think so!</p>
<p>You were in our cross hairs last year, didn’t you learn from your mistakes and bad judgments? Now it’s too late to expect us.</p>
<p>We ask you nicely to stand down and cancel the picketing. We advise you all to take this seriously. This is not a threat, this is a promise!</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We will not forget,</p>
