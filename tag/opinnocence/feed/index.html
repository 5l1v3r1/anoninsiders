<p>Greetings. On Saturday, June 1, 2013 at high noon, Anonymous will host a rally at the Hancock County Courthouse, 102 Court St  New Cumberland, West Virginia in support of Baby Jane Doe and the good citizens of the Ohio Valley. Anonymous is deeply troubled by the release of alleged baby rapist Tyler Graham. All citizens should feel the same way. Will it be allowed to continue with no outcry? No, it will not.</p>
<p>Anonymous demands to know why Graham was released when the courts, after his last arrest, specified that he be held until trial. He violated release conditions once, should we not expect a repeat performance? What provisions are in place to prevent this? We demand answers.</p>
<p>Is Baby Jane safe within her present surroundings? Anonymous has reasons to believe this is not the case. Has the West Virginia DHHR done a full and complete investigation as we demanded? We have no evidence of this. Again, we demand answers.</p>
<p>Anonymous invites Tyler Graham, his attorney, the parents of Baby Jane, and all other interested parties to attend our rally and state your version of events. We invite local and National media to join us. It is your duty to bring this story to the citizens of the Ohio Valley and the World. We suggest you cease ignoring us and do your jobs. You will find we are not easily ignored.</p>
<p>This will be a peaceful rally. We remind everyone that the Hancock County and City of Weirton Law Enforcement community is not the enemy. They have done their jobs well, they have been let down by the system just as the citizens have. We rally in support of them, not against them.</p>
<p>We ask rally attendees to wear red if possible to represent our anger at the current situation.</p>
<p>That is all</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.<br />
The Corrupt Fear Us.<br />
The Honest Support Us.<br />
The Heroic Join Us.<br />
Expect Justice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="620" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-5VV_u7dPw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In late February of this year, 19-year old Tyler Graham, of Weirton, West Virginia, was arrested for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim, the 2-year old daughter of Graham&#8217;s girlfriend, who we will decline to identify at this time, was brutally sodomized and contracted a sexually transmitted disease, specifically venereal warts. Apparently the child&#8217;s mother believed the baby had diaper rash and took her to the pediatrician. The pediatrician promptly referred the child to a specialist who reported the matter to police. Extensive surgery was required to correct this case of &#8220;diaper rash&#8221;. The baby remained in the custody of her mother.</p>
<p>Anonymous became involved when a Hancock County Magistrate saw fit to release Graham on bond. On Saturday, March 2, the first OpInnocence rally was held on the steps of the Hancock County Courthouse in New Cumberland, West Virginia. Warmly welcomed by Hancock County Sheriff Ralph Fletcher and his Chief Deputy, approximately 60 Anonymous activists and concerned citizens braved bitterly cold weather to make their feelings known on this issue.<br />
Less than a week after the rally, Graham was rearrested and his bond revoked for approaching too closely to the home of the victim. Anonymous was satisfied with this outcome and the operation entered a dormant stage. This has now changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Several days ago, on May 13, Graham appeared before Judge Martin Gaughan for what was expected to be a simple matter of setting a trial date. Instead, Graham was again released into the community. After waiving his right to a speedy trial, Graham was given a next appearance date of September 19. For five long months this monster will walk freely among the good citizens of the Ohio Valley. At that point, there may be a trial date set, when &#8211;nobody knows&#8211; or there may be another continuance. Anonymous finds this unacceptable.</p>
<p>Outraged yet? The worst is yet to come; Anonymous has received multiple reports that the child&#8217;s mother continues to associate with the accused, Tyler Graham. Again, Anonymous finds this unacceptable.</p>
<p>Anonymous demands an immediate review of Judge Gaughan&#8217;s decision to release this animal among our children. We also demand the immediate involvement of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources to determine the safety of the child in her current surroundings. Your failure to perform these actions will result in your town becoming the next Steubenville, Ohio in the media spotlight. Do the right thing by your citizens immediately or read about your errors in every media outlet in the country. This is non-negotiable.<br />
Operation Innocence is re-engaged.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why was an alleged toddler rapist allowed to post bail?</p>
<p>March 2, 2013 @ Hancock County Courthouse, New Cumberland, WV 26047 &#8211; 12:00pm-3:00pm.  Organized by Anonymous and concerned citizens of the community.</p>
<p>This will be a peaceful protest/vigil to support the victim and her family, and to ask the authorities why Tyler Graham was allowed to post $50,000 bail for such a heinous accusation.  </p>
<p>As members of the the human race we find this intolerable and unacceptable. This has angered the hive. It is of utmost importance that this crime allegedly committed by Tyler Graham, and any possible accomplices is prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>We want it to be known that protesters, including those who remain Anonymous will not be arriving to cause a disturbance, we are simply there to be a voice for the little Jane Doe that cannot speak for herself, and according to reports is terrified to speak of the incident to the authorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are there to support all persons who face abuse, whether it be physical, emotional, or sexual, online or in &#8220;real life.&#8221;  In a civilized society, this cannot be allowed to stand.  </p>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we will stand united as a voice for all Jane and John Does, who have faced unspeakable pain, and may be unable to speak for themselves.  You deserve justice.</p>
<p>The theme of this protest will be &#8220;QUESTIONS.&#8221; While it is not required, we suggest that attendees bring a sign with a simple, large question mark. We want to know WHY?</p>
<p>Why was Tyler Graham allowed to post bail for such a heinous accusation?<br />
Why in a civilized country, is rape culture not only allowed to exist, but to THRIVE?<br />
Why aren&#8217;t we doing more to teach our children that this type of behavior is NOT OKAY?</p>
<p>If necessary, the protests will continue, as they have in the neighboring community of Steubenville, Ohio.  Sexual assault has turned a spotlight onto this part of the country.  While the majority of citizens in the region have been thankful for our work, some have felt that this attention has been a plague.  The plague is the lack of humanity shown by a small group of &#8220;people.&#8221;  We are the antibiotic to this plague.</p>
