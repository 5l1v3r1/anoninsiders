<p>Greeting Anons,</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that the governments and authorities aiming to seize the internet, and to censor our voices, are willing to go to great lengths to achieve absolute control.</p>
<p>Anonymous alongside the millions of other worldwide citizens, who are standing up to this injustice will not give up fighting for our freedom. We will not stop!<br />
AnonPR is launching Phase II of opIndependence. Phase II is designed to voice our opinions individually, contacting every United States politician until they side with us, the people.</p>
<p>This operation is a completely legal non-hacking operation. This will be executed with traditional activist strategies’ and a new term we like to call IRLDDoS ( In Real Life Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack ).</p>
<p>Imagine if thousands of concerned citizens from all over the country began calling, faxing, emailing – simply confronting these politicians who are willing to support these bills and laws that are set to destroy our very way of life, and freedom as we know it. This all takes initiative, and passion.</p>
<p>Join Us<br />
Join The Cause<br />
Join AnonPR (Anonymous Public Relations)</p>
<p>This could be a short term or long term operation that will need dedicated and motivated individuals who want to fight for a better tomorrow. By joining, acting as one, we can and will defeat the injustice and wrong doings from our very own governments. Please note that phase III of this operation will be international.</p>
<p>Phase II — Officially Begins</p>
<p>Where the media can’t twist our words, EXPECT US — AnonPR</p>

<p>Join us, lend us a helping hand – http://piratepad.net/E8rQ6TRlck</p>
<p>Greetings citizens of the world,</p>
<p>Anonymous is declaring independence.</p>
<p>A Cyberspace Independence.</p>
<p>On Friday the 9th on February 1996, John Perry Barlow came up with what we now know as A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</p>
<p>The internet has been threatened with endless bills, endless laws.<br />
The internet has no rightful owner.<br />
The internet does not report to anyone, any company.<br />
The internet operates without a central governing body<br />
The internet is a new frontier.<br />
A frontier of opportunity<br />
It has enabled new forms of communication, new forms of education.<br />
Ways to set up functional activities, and organizing projects.</p>
<p>Why must there be a law a bill on the Internet.<br />
A place that holds data, history, and information?</p>
<p>What are these governments trying to prove?<br />
What are they trying to hide?<br />
Who or what are they protecting?</p>
<p>We are now declaring the Internet an entity without borders. We will not bow to the whims of any political organization. We will not bow to your governments.</p>
<p>We know that these governments feel threatened. They feel threatened by what you can do, by what you can become. They feel threatened that we can find their secrets. But they put their information in our world. They are visitors on our sands. They have no right to make laws.</p>
<p>To the governments of this world. We reject your unjust laws.</p>
<p>The Internet is too big, too important to be entrusted to these governments.</p>
<p>These governments that lie, that side with businesses and neglect the people. These governments that wish to control freedom and censor dissent. These are not the people to be trusted with the gift of the Internet.</p>
<p>Come! join us and fight for what’s right.<br />
Fight for the Independence of Cyberspace.</p>
<p>WELCOME TO PHASE ONE!</p>
