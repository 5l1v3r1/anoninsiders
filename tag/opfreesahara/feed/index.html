<p>DEAR CITIZENS OF THE WORLD. We are anonymous. </p>
<p>Anonymous can not, and will not stand idly while people are being denied their basic rights and human liberties. Yet, there are still a lot of governments worldwide who fail to even aspire to the standard of freedom that was set by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p>
<p>This is an urgent message. A new and terrible thing is happening in the western sahara territory occupied by Morocco, increasing every year to the silence of the world as politicians and media. </p>
<p>What happened on Saturday, March 23rd, in the streets of the occupied city of El Aaiun on the sidelines of the visit of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Christopher Ross, to Western Sahara, and before that in the occupied city of Boujdour, on 18 February 2013, when Moroccan security authorities, based on official orders and in the presence of senior security officials, violently attacked Saharawi women, who were peacefully protesting, disrobing them on public streets, as well as harassing and threatening them to rape in public. </p>
<p>The Sahrawi people suffer torture, arbitrary detention, forced disappearances, and other human rights violations at the hands of the Moroccan government with total impunity. And more than 100,000 refugees are left living in temporary camps outside Tindouf, Algeria, separated from their families and afraid to return home. </p>
<p>As these abuses continue, the United Nations Peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, does not have a human rights mandate to investigate and report on these ongoing violations. </p>
<p>The United States must take action against the human rights violations facing the Sahrawi people living in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and in refugee camps near Tindouf, Algeria. </p>
