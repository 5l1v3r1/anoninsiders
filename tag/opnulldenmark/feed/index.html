<p>Today we fight against one of the most vile laws that has passed inside of Denmark. The ability to legal have sexual intercourse with animals! Yes people you read that right &#8212; In detial, we are talking about DogBrothels.</p>
<blockquote><p>IT&#8217;S ABOUT OVER TURNING A LAW , THAT MAKES RAPING DOGS LEGAL , WHILE POLITICIANS ALLOW IT ! MUCH LIKE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY , IT IS HIDDEN UNDERGROUND BUT MANY ARE AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE !</p></blockquote>
<p>Laws in both Denmark and Norway are fairly open when it comes to a person’s legal right to engage in sexual activity with an animal. The law states that doing so is perfectly legal, as long as the animal involved does not suffer. According to the Danish newspaper 24timer.com, this interesting gap in the law has led to a flourishing business. People pay in order to have sex with animals. On the internet, several Danish animal owners openly advertise their services. The newspaper contacted several such individuals and was told that many of the animals have been engaged in this kind of activity for several years and that the animals crave the sexual stimulation. The newspaper found that the cost charged by the animal owners varied from DKK 500 to 1,000 (USD$85 to $170).</p>
<p>Since Danish laws are so similar to Norwegian laws, the animal bordello phenomenon has led many to question if such a practice could be legal in Norway as well.</p>
<p>Testimonies from actual residents::</p>
<p>&#8220;“It could be that the animals don’t really care,” Knaevelsrud said. “But I think it is in the nature of the case that animals will often be victims of injury, stress or suffering in connection with sexual acts with humans. Either that they are held fast, or frightened, or suffer pain or physical injury,” Knaevelsrud said.&#8221; &#8220;If we will not stand up for the rights of our precious animals who will?!!&#8221; &#8220;We will not stand for such abuse, such ignorance against innocent animals!&#8221;</p>
