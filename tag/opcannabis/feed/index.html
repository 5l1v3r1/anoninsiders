<p>Greetings Citizens of the World</p>
<p>Groundbreaking discoveries have been made recently in research relating to the medical benefits of Cannabis sativa in the treatment of cancer. Among the most noteworthy:</p>
<p>Cannabinoids reduce the spread and growth of cancer, including breast cancer, oral cancer, colon cancer, and skin cancer.<br />
Cannabinoids disrupt cancer cellsâ€™ metastasis and interrupt their usual cell cycle.<br />
Cannabinoids make cancer cells kill themselves, without affecting healthy cells.<br />
Cannabinoids reduces the spread of tumors and can lead to complete tumor regression.<br />
Cannabinoids used in cancer treatment have no neurotoxic effects. None!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for best interest of the public, these discoveries remain largely unpublicized.</p>
<p>We suspect this to be the result of the medical industries inability to make money off of a common plant that anyone can grow easily in their backyard. We urge you to SHARE WITH EVERYONE the outcomes of the most recent scientific literature. This would be especially relevant to those suffering of a wide variety of cancers, tumors and other terminal illnesses. Cannabis has been shown to be surprisingly effective at treating some of the most dramatic symptoms and help in pain management.</p>
<p>The published and peer reviewed research is based on solid and unbiased evidences. The scientists involved are publicly funded and are not profiting off your suffering. There is no reason not to make this information more widely available. On April 20th 2013, Cannabis Appreciation Day, we have one simple request: talk to the people you know, who suffer from cancer or other diseases known to be help by cannabis, about the benefits of medical Cannabis. With Cannabis inevitably on peoples minds, this will be an excellent opportunity to discuss the subject . Helping alleviating people suffering by having them considering, and hopefully using cannabis will do more than any protest to advance its legalization.</p>
