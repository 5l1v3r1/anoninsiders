<p>Greetings Citizens of the world, We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>It is important to understand first, that we are beginning a time of transition in our world. Those around us previously asleep to the injustices being committed around them, are waking up. They are speaking up for what they believe in, coming out of their homes to join hands and fight against corruption and scarcity. In the past, most would have moved on with their lives without questioning any aspect of the powers that be. Now however, we see the masses beginning to stand up; questioning if what they have been led to believe is all that exists. Those that control our economy, our money, our lives, are not always right, nor just. and it is our duty as citizens of this Earth, to stand up for one another, to face the burden that has been laid upon us, as one. Anonymous has always maintained a presence on the internet. It is time now, brothers and sisters, to take our message to the streets.</p>
<p>Operation Mass Effect has been engaged. This is a message to Anonymous Street Crews around the world. While your operations locally have undoubtedly made an impact on your community, there are many of our brothers and sisters, outside your region of operation, that have not yet realized there are organized collectives of anons among them. Operation Mass Effect&#8217;s goal is to reach out to those who support the Anonymous movement that haven&#8217;t yet found their way to the streets. Many citizens have followed the actions of anonymous closely, and wish to support the revolution, but have limited technological skills. It is important to highlight, that you need not be a hacker to be Anonymous, as we are all Anonymous.</p>
<p>It is time now, brothers and sisters, to reach out to those that wish to begin street crews in their home towns. Travel to areas outside your normal region of operations and spread our message. It is always encouraged to run operations with 3 or more anons for your own safety. However, one anon wearing their mask on a street corner, informing the public, making them think, is part of Operation Mass Effect. By making a presence in these outside regions, you will most assuredly run across supporters of the anonymous movement. Inform them of operations in your area. Invite them to your gatherings so they can learn for themselves how to re-create their own collectives in their home towns. In doing this, you will provide them an opportunity to experience the same success and satisfaction you have found within your own collective, and give them the tools necessary to help build and inspire future Anons to take to the streets and defend their rights as citizens of this earth. Together, united as one, we will help our brothers and sisters grow from a glowing ember to a raging inferno in the darkness.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
United as one.<br />
Divided by zero.<br />
We are everywhere.<br />
We are everyone.<br />
We control the internet.<br />
Now we take control of the streets</p>
