<p>In the past, when a new Anonymous operation revealed itself to the world and announced its intentions, people asked themselves how they felt about supporting the cause. Disinformation and a fear of disobedience strongly influence the personal decisions of the majority. One might begin to construct a personal barrier between goals and operations believed to have been founded immorally or to restrict oneself to causes deemed “socially correct”.</p>
<p>This artificial barricade is expected to help differentiate between what is right and wrong; good and bad, and for a while it may even work. It’s easy to be content with a strategy of analyzing and categorizing everything into two separate groups and then comparing those groups to the previous decisions that one has made.</p>
<p>Today, however, the distinction between good and bad is almost impossible to perceive. As Anonymous continues to evolve, the realization is that there can be no hope of fully understanding the implications of the actions of this collective, and the ramifications that support for a cause may have to the entire world.<br />
Who could have guessed that <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpEgypt" rel="nofollow">#OpEgypt</a> would have had such a profound effect on the country of Egypt and that it would eventually be responsible (contributed too?) for a dramatic change of government?</p>
<p>In this new era, it is not correct to question whether the actions of our Collective are moral or immoral. Today we must ask ourselves how immoral or corrupt the organizations and governments we stand against are, and question the morality of their objectives for humanity. This is not simply an evolution of thinking, but also a redefinition of perception so that we are not stuck in the archaic and monochromatic style of categorizing people and groups based on a standard that each of us define individually. Instead, we now have the chance to computationally evaluate our persona and normalize our differences to actually see how everything stands against the backdrop of the rest of our world.</p>
<p>When corruption triumphs and governments prevaricate to their people, it is not our job to infuse morality back into the dying systems that have ultimately failed us. Instead it is our job to change, evolve, and transform collectively into a society that is able to take on this corruption and eradicate it by any means necessary; even in a barbaric and savage way. We must unite to wage a revolution against any who would attempt to exercise control over us.</p>
<p>With the world burning before our very eyes, and everything an untamed free-for-all, we must remember: it was our decision to put these people into power, in trust, and give them the chance to help us form societies that would benefit everyone. It was THEIR decision to betray our trust and the ideals for which they were chosen to serve. We must understand that they have betrayed the trust that we invested into them and that they intend to forget about the communities that they were employed to serve.</p>
<p>As with every revolution in the history of the world, there are many ways that we can go about changing these systems that govern our lives to better support the world that we now live in. We deserve the opportunity to tear down the barriers of morality that we ourselves have built, because we will not be able to combat the corruption and malicious intent of these political systems without first comprehending them at their most fundamental level.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we must resolve to not become as corrupt and immoral as the systems that we fight… yet be fearless in taking action against our oppressors in a fierce and most determined manner. If we are to ever hope to overcome these over-reaching governments and corrupt politicians, we must re-evaluate ourselves and decide that we are not willing to back down and admit defeat! We are willing to stand up for what we believe in, and declare our sovereignty! We must rise and seize the power back from the depraved oligarchy that exists in every nation.</p>
<p>As the time nears for us to begin our modern war on the corruption that exists in our world, you must examine your beliefs become the change you want to see, even if you have to change the world just to be heard. It is time that we as a global community exercise the power to redefine the institutions that wish to interdict our rights. Stand up, join us and show the world that Anonymous is not a collective that can simply be ignored.</p>
