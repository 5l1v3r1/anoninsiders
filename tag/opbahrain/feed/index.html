<p>Greetings World</p>
<p>We are Anonymous. And we have watched since the last Grand Prix F1 race in Manama, Bahrain. Since last year, we have had millions of eyes trained on the continuing oppression of our freedom loving brethren in Bahrain by the self-made &#8220;King&#8221; in Manama. Since last year, when Anonymous in solidarity with hundreds of thousands of Bahraini &#8211; shut down the Grand Prix F1 race and said &#8220;no&#8221; to blood racing. One year since Anonymous dumped the personal information including credit card and passport numbers, of all the F1 attendees in Bahrain &#8211; and yet Bernnie Eccelstone and the &#8220;Royal Family&#8221; of Bahrain have learned nothing. So we are coming forward this year to wreck your little party again Mr. Eccelstone. Anonymous will not stand by and allow you a race fueled by the blood of our freedom loving comrades in Bahrain.</p>
<p>Beginning with the opening festivities of your little blood race, you can expect the presence of Anons from all over the globe inside your intertoobz. We will remove you from the world wide web, whether you be Grand Prix or Bahrain government &#8211; we shall take it all down. We will expose the personal data of any person who supports this race in any way. You have been warned. Once the festivities for this race begin in Bahrain, all bets are off. We call upon Bernie Eccelstone while there is still time; cancel your blood race now.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous<br />
We Are Everywhere<br />
We Are Legion<br />
We Do Not Forgive<br />
We Do Not Forget</p>
<p>Bernie Eccelstone &amp; Bahrain Royal Family, it&#8217;s too late to&#8230;</p>
<p>EXPECTÂ  US</p>

<p>Citizens of the world,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>For over one year the people of Bahrain have peacefully protested in the streets for freedom, justice, and democracy. They have been met with tear gas, live ammunition, torture, kidnapping and death while the United Nations and countries around the world turn their backs.</p>
<p>People have been imprisoned for the crime of &#8216;advocating human rights.&#8217; Citizens whose families have been murdered by the government are arrested, women are raped, tear gas is fired in to homes at night and infants lay dead.</p>
<p>We demand the Bahraini government stop killing its people. We demand they put an end to their Human Rights violations, stop arresting and torturing their citizens, and stop the use of mercenaries against their own people. We demand the immediate release of all human rights activists and all those jailed for political &#8220;crimes.&#8221; We also demand the Qorvis corporation and other American P R firms stop working on behalf of the Bahraini government and stop their active campaigns of disinformation, lies, and harassment of activists.</p>
<p>We will lay waste to your servers, spread the truth about your illegitimate government, show solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Bahrain and expose your crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>To the people of Bahrain, continue protesting. Continue demonstrating peacefully. You have the support of the people of the world and you will have the freedom you deserve.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Bahrainian Government, Expect us.</p>
