<p>Anonymous watched with outrage as the SPVM (Montreal Police) on January 7th brutally attacked the homeless encampment at Viger Square, removing the homeless people living there and destroying all of there belongings. Op Safe Winter Montreal was particularly outraged that all of the material that we had provided to the Viger Square encampment on December 23rd was confiscated and disposed of. Quebec is currently in the midst of a severe cold weather period, with temperatures plummeting to life threatening lows. Raiding encampments and destroying precious cold weather gear belonging to the homeless is an act of war against the poorest of the poor and could easily result in the death of these vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>Anonymous will not stand by and allow the SPVM (Montreal Police) and the City of Montreal to attack homeless camps in the middle of winter. We call on everyone in Montreal to occupy Viger Square on Sunday &#8211; January 11, 2015 to re-establish and protect the encampment there. We will create a sanctuary for the homeless, protect the encampment &#8211; and begin providing basic services to them such as serving hot meals. Everyone should make there way to Viger Square on Sunday morning, bringing with them cold weather camping gear and supplies &#8211; and be prepared to live there with the homeless people until our demands are met. Everyone should also bring with them protective gear such as gas masks, material for building barricades, and anything else that might be useful in defending the encampment should it be attacked by the SPVM (Montreal Police).</p>
<p>Anonymous demands that the government of Montreal enact legislation creating a permanent moratorium on the raids of homeless encampments from December 1st to March 1st during which time the SPVM (Montreal Police) will be strictly forbidden to attack or harass any homeless encampment within the City of Montreal. Until this demand is met, we will continue to occupy Viger Square, protest in the streets of Montreal &#8211; and attack the cyber infrastructure of the City of Montreal and other entities as we see fit.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous &#8211; We Are Legion &#8211; We Will Not Forgive Attacks On The Homeless &#8211; We Will Not Forget The Heartless Destruction Of The Viger Square Camp</p>
<p>City Of Montreal &#038; SPVM&#8230;.Expect Us</p>

<p>Greetings we are Anonymous.</p>
<p>We come to you once again to ask for your help in making the lives of those less fortunate more bearable.<br />
In times like these when it seems humanity, tolerance and peace is hard to find, it falls to us the ordinary citizens of this planet to show there is still love, compassion and respect left in the world.</p>
<p>Operation Safewinter was and still is about caring first and helping second. A kind word, the willingness to listen and even a smile can change a persons day, but a blanket, some warm clothes or even a sandwich can change a persons life.</p>
<p>We ask you to help us help those who are suffering the most in our societies, we do not ask for donations of money, just donations of time.</p>
<p>The Operation Safewinter mission is in three phases.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1.</strong><br />
To build an interactive map showing the locations of shelter, soup kitchens, advice centres etc worldwide. This phase has already begun, but we need your help. List the resources in your town or city and send it to us. Use the map to know where these places are locally and pass on this<br />
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2.</strong><br />
Encourage volunteer units to help gather blankets and clothing to be distributed out to those that need them most. Using the map, work with already established groups in your areas to help even if its just an hour per week. Make sandwiches, cakes and hand out food parcels. Bottles of water are most important.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3.</strong><br />
To save just one life this winter, to make the day better for just one person. To work together and show that even though it seems the world is out of control with respect, love and compassion that we as citizens of this planet still have our humanity.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Operation Safewinter re-engaged.<br />
Expect us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/op-safe-winter-2014-300x189.png" alt="I learned to give, not because I have much but because I know how it feel to have nothing." class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2653" /></center></p>
<p>OpSafeWinter, one of Anonymous’ most effective non-hacking Ops, is back (not that it actually went away) and we’ve got an interview with the international team behind it. As is traditional, the interviewees declined to identify themselves, other than as organizers of OpSafeWinter.</p>
<p>Launched November 7 of 2013, the operation aims to support the homeless by providing basic needs like food, warm clothing and camping supplies, as well as by raising public awareness of the housing crisis. It’s also one of the most “outreachy” operations, working alongside non-Anon organizations and individuals who are already active in fighting homelessness. The op grew spontaneously and inevitably out of various winter holiday-themed ops scattered around the globe which had been perennially popping up, winter over winter. In its first year, OpSafeWinter boasted participation from 12 countries on an official basis, and several others on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>The most active countries in last year’s coalition were the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23UK" rel="nofollow">#UK</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23US" rel="nofollow">#US</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Brazil" rel="nofollow">#Brazil</a>, where the normally fearsome &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackBloc" rel="nofollow">#BlackBloc</a>&#8217; were highly active in a food and toys drive in Sao Paulo. Throughout the year several local groups continued their operations, liaising with non-Anonymous organizations, creating resource banks, offering soup kitchens and more. Portland produced a Million Blanket March, in solidarity with the spirit of the November 5 Million Mask March. The UK’s East Coast Homeless Outreach project, which is up for an award from the Lloyds Bank Foundation, grew out of the operation. Organizer JediKnight says, “Nov 5th I am planning <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpFeedTheHomeless" rel="nofollow">#OpFeedTheHomeless</a> in London. I have teams ready on standby for donations to give to homeless on the streets all night. We want all people going to London to bring a drink and a sandwich to donate.”</p>
<p>In traditional Anonymous fashion, the press release was posted on Pastebin first, with a video follow-up. This year’s op specifically calls on participants to help create a census of the homeless in each locale, as well as indexing services both civilian and Anonymous.</p>
<h2>Press Release</h2>
<p>Fellow Anon and Citizens of the world, We are proud to re-announce <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OPSafeWinter" rel="nofollow">#OPSafeWinter</a>. In this age of consumerism there is very little love or care about each other, and we’re here to change that. No longer shall we stand by and watch isolation and fear be spread by the establishment, which is killing and destroying community and lives. We all have a voice, so make yours heard, you are the power, your choice, your life, you are the motivation for justice.</p>

<h2>Interview</h2>
<p>The Cryptosphere: What is different about this year’s OpSafeWinter?</p>
<p>AnonymousA: We started with a great team last year, some members have left, some found us as the op progressed, we feel we start this year with a stronger team, with a better idea of whats required.</p>
<p>AnonymousB: In spite of its name, OpSafeWinter was designed to continue year round. Those involved in the Op are global partners and winter happens somewhere on Earth at any given time. Several groups continued the Op through the summer, some calling it OpSafeSummer. Homelessness is growing on Earth, by leaps and bounds, so continuing the Op throughout the year was an effective way to combat homelessness. This year is different because we have set a precedent as a collective last year. We have a solid base from which to start and we have made great friends with many people all over who are continuing the Op. We also have an idea of what to expect from law enforcement and TPTB this year. Plus, experience with something is always a benefit.</p>
<p>AnonymousA: A honeypot was setup against opsafewinter [in other words, Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/ihazcandy" rel="nofollow">&commat;ihazcandy</a> tried to obtain supporters&#8217; IP addresses, presumably so they could collect a list of activists marked for future surveillance]. See http://pastebin.com/qf1S1LN0 and Operation Safe Winter – http://pastebin.com/pcm9dR98. Why anyone would want to attack an operation to help the homeless is beyond me, the guy should stick to chasing ISIL! The pad release (at time of writing this) was less than 48hrs old, hits already 1442. http://pastebin.com/7M8xe7Br [4451 now]</p>
<p>AnonymousB: We have some forward motion from the success of the Op last year, so we hope that this year people will already be familiar with the idea and practices involved in OpSafeWinter.</p>
<p>TheCryptosphere: What are you seeing in terms of international participation? Are certain nations more active and enthusiastic about the op than others?</p>
<p>AnonymousA: Well we have had a surprising result, to be honest. We were taken aback because the op was originally designed on the irc in a chat, just bouncing ideas off each other, and to our amazement within 2 weeks it had gone global. What shocked everyone was the heartfelt response from all around the globe. People just started giving out food, clothes … they just shared the idea and it grew exponentially.</p>
<p>We were kinda shocked also at the business-like and negative response from a lot of charities that we thought would understand and help people down on their luck. It was a Show By Example op which grew and grew. We are of the opinion people want to do and feel good, but with the governments of the world for examples they’re not getting good role models.</p>
<p>Each and every country is different, it has its own culture and the op seems to have touched everyone. It was a spectacular response, and it’s growing daily.</p>
<p>We will be ensuring plenty of disclaimers are shown highlighting we will not be asking for monetary donations. Any campaign asking for monetary donations will be seriously vetted before a hint of endorsement is shown.</p>
<p>TheCryptosphere: What kind of media coverage has the op had?</p>
<p>AnonymousB: We have had some amazing radio coverage from all over the world.</p>
<p>AnonymousA: Elite daily &#038; some homeless publications in the UK also reported. Mainstream media is sort of lacking, but we see them as part of the problem, doing their governments’ bidding, but all in all we’ve had a fantastic coverage by all that take part. The internet is a great place to share.</p>
<p>TheCryptosphere: Do you seek changes in government policy or do you prefer citizen action?</p>
<p>AnonymousA: We don’t see national or local governments policies changing to help individuals. Thats why this op has taken off so well around the globe; people don’t like what they see, so the only way they can change it is by making the change themselves. People will always show their governemts up and try to change things for the better. At present a lot of the groups that carried this on throughout the year are having issues with local government, but its being ironed out, charity is charity, its none negotiable when people want to good for one another in a genuine and unconditional, so unfortunately it will rock the boat for big business, but businesses are asked to help, its their choice to act now.</p>
<p>AnonymousB: We have actually seen changes in the government in some areas of the world in regards to helping to feed some less fortunate folks. Some jurisdictions have even gone so far as to outlaw the practice of providing food to the homeless. They cite safety (what else) concerns for the organizations and the homeless population alike.</p>
<p>The Cryptosphere: What is the specific goal of the op? Has it changed at all from last year? And what would total success look like for the Op?</p>
<p>AnonymousA: No change, if you help one person survive winter, great success. This year though, we have set up an email for people to send us info on their group/organization: contactopsafewinter@gmail.com and we will put them on a global map, having all the help accessable to the homeless and less fortunate can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>AnonymousB: The first goal of the Op was basically awareness: finding out the numbers of homeless in your specific area, and raising awareness about the plight of these marginalized people. Success would be the annihilation of homelessness, but we’re looking to be a bit more pragmatic at first.</p>
<p>Success would be people recognizing that homeless people are just that…PEOPLE. They deserve compassion and care, just like anyone else. Some actual full-blown shelters have been set up as a result of the Op, [whereas] some see success as a Feed The Homeless Day or a blanket give away.</p>
<blockquote><p>We think being human is the success, reminding people that we are just as vulnerable as these homeless folks are. In a heartbeat we could be out on the streets ourselves: war, climate change, financial difficulty…it’s all taking a toll on humanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>January 11th was the one year anniversary of the death of digital rights champion Aaron Swartz. He allegedly took his own life while facing up to 50 years in prison for violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) arising from the downloading of millions of documents from the online research group JSTOR. The Swartz family stated that this was &#8220;the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach&#8221; and rightfully blasted Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for failing to support Aaron Swartz in his legal battles and refusing to stand up for &#8220;its own community&#8217;s most cherished principles.” Not only was his death a huge loss for his family, but it was a loss in the fight for freedom of information.<br />

<p>From <a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/">The Day We Fight Back</a> :<br />
“In January 2012 we defeated the SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation with the largest Internet protest in history. A year ago this month one of that movement&#8217;s leaders, Aaron Swartz, tragically passed away.  Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet, and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society: mass surveillance.  If Aaron were alive, he&#8217;d be on the front lines, fighting against a world in which governments observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.  Now, on the the anniversary of Aaron&#8217;s passing, and in celebration of the win against SOPA and PIPA that he helped make possible, we are planning a day of protest against mass surveillance, to take place this February 11th.”</p>
<p><a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/press/">Full press release</a></p>
<p>Denver&#8217;s solidarity day of protest will be February 5th to coincide with our Million Mask March IV which take place the 5th of every month.<br />
As we celebrate our past wins we keep in the forefront the current threats against our privacy and rights to free speech.</p>
<p>NSA<br />
We are against having our every communication monitored. The NSA&#8217;s far overreaching surveillance programs threaten the the privacy and personal liberties of every citizen, regardless of “legal status,” and undermines the Fourth Amendment. We deny the NSA any claim over our data/metadata. We are including Model Legislation that our state lawmakers can use to fight the encroachment of this modern Stasi. Oklahoma has done it, so why can&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>TPP<br />
We are against the Trans-Pacific Partnership because its provisions about internet copyright law, maintained by an imperialist and inhuman global financial system, cut off our collective voice and our access to source material crucial to building dual power.<br />

<p>According to a September 2013 report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research “Estimates of the U.S. economic gains that would result from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are very small — only 0.13 percent of GDP by 2025.” We ask, what&#8217;s the human cost for this pitiful financial gain?<br />

<p>Countries around the Earth will suffer from increased medical costs as well as deregulation of International Environmental Protection Standards which will allow corporations to unleash mayhem with little to no oversight of their undermining of the People&#8217;s electrical, water and gas sources as well as encouraging deforestation on large scales.<br />

<p>“Immigration reform legislation is also moving forward. The proposed reform includes a “border surge” of militarization and related benchmarks that must go into effect before road to citizenship provisions kick in. This surge would include between $30 and $50 billion for “security,” including the construction of 350 to 700 more miles of the border wall. The number of agents on the border would be doubled to 40,000. The US-Mexico border would become one of the most militarized borders in the world.”</p>
<p>“Also closely related is the proliferation of private prisons, especially immigration detention centers. Militarized borders and new prisons help manage social disruptions as well as political dissent resulting from FTAs. Criminalization of the undocumented creates a sub-class of workers denied basic labor rights while forced to work long hours for low wages. The ones who benefit are transnational corporations and agribusinesses.”<br />

<p>Political Prisoners</p>
<p>We will march in solidarity with ALL political prisoners of the police state.  We will not stop fighting for the release of Jeremy Hammond, Barrett Brown and Pvt. Chelsea Manning, as well as the following prisoners:</p>

<p>And in solidarity with the Feb 6th anniversary of Leonard Peltier&#8217;s arrest, we march for all indigenous prisoners.</p>
<p>“Leonard Peltier is a Native American activist wrongfully accused in 1975 in connection with the shooting deaths of two agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Government documents show that, without any evidence at all, the FBI decided from the beginning of its investigation to ‘lock Peltier into the case’.”</p>
<p>http://denverabc.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/international-day-of-solidarity-with-leonard-peltier-february-4-2012/</p>
<p>We demand the immediate release of ALL political prisoners who have not had their appeals met by the corrupted powers of the Federal government, which seeks to undermine our self-determination as Free People of the World, including those fighting for Black Liberation Freedom such as:</p>

<p>Amenities for warm showers etc.</p>
<p>1st Mission Please list the current homeless count in alphabetical order by town/City Country<br />
Within each town contact local charities, shops, businesses that will support with any of the above list and more.<br />
You can get the latest figures from your local council by sending them a freedom of information request if you are not sure of the figures in your town.</p>
<p>2nd Mission, coordinate with anons and others willing to participate in the execution/distribution of services we are able to provide. Whether its&#8217; transport, collection of donations etc.<br />
This is not definitive, any other suggestions ideas are welcome. Please list at the bottom of the pad as bullet points to make it easy to follow.</p>
