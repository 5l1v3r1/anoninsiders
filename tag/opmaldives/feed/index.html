<p>In a recent press release by Maldives Police, they have singled out Anonymous Maldives as a threat to &#8220;citizens of the Maldives&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have exposed more than a 200,000 thousand National ID Card details on our site <a href="http://maldives.anonymous.lv">maldives.anonymous.lv</a> on December 2013. This was done in the interest of making the citizens of the Maldives aware that how insecure our Government Authorities are. We want to make it clear that this was done in no way to threaten any citizens rights. We do not wish to &#038; will never terrorize our nation.</p>
<p>We have found traitors working in the Authorities who claims they are &#8220;IT/Security Experts&#8221;. We call on the Election Comission to fire these traitors and secure our personal information. We will continue to penetrate into Government Websites just to help them improve their security. Sites we penetrate will not be permenantly damaged, nor we will harm the infrastructure of Maldives. We have simply shown how insecure our government is.</p>
<p>Police Authorities claimed that they have taken down our mirror site <a href="http://maldives.anonymous.lv">maldives.anonymous.lv</a>, but until now we still have our domain and it was never seized and cannot be. Our current mirror is <a href="http://press.anonymous.lv">press.anonymous.lv</a> as a result of Government censoring our previous mirror <a href="http://maldives.anonymous.lv">maldives.anonymous.lv</a>. If you cut down one Anon, ten more will join us purely out of anger at your trampling of dissent.</p>
<p>Anonymous does not have leaders. We are not a group, we are not an organization. We are just an idea. We will respond to those who seek to threaten us, even if it&#8217;s the Government. We understand that our participants have been concerned about the lies spread by Maldives Police Service in their press statement on 21st October 2013.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us!</p>
