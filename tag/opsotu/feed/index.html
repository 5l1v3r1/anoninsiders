<p>Article II, Sector 3 of the US Constitution, says the President &#8220;shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.&#8221; </p>
<p>At 9PM Eastern Standard Time, February 13, 2013 President Obama has planned to address a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address.<br />
The following day, President Obama will be introducing an executive order, purportedly aimed at bolstering U.S. cyber-security, after repeated failed attempts to pass legislation through Congress.</p>
<p>Anonymous has reached a verdict of NO CONFIDENCE in this executive order and the plans to reintroduce the CISPA bill to Congress on the same day. As such, President Obama and the State of the Union Address will be BANISHED from the Internet for the duration of live delivery. </p>
<p>So as not to infringe upon the President&#8217;s free speech, subsequent broadcasts will be allowed to pass unhindered.<br />
This action is being taken to underline a fact that appears to be sorely unrecognized by the Obama Administration &#8212; that the Internet is a sovereign territory, and does not fall under the jurisdiction of any nation state. </p>
<p>We are the natives of this space, and its guardians, and we will fight until death to protect it as a neutral grounds for the unhindered interaction of all members of the human race, so long as they themselves act in harmony with this inviolable principle.</p>
<p>Our determination is that President Obama is acting in direct contravention of this principle, and his brief exclusion is an educational, rather than a punitive measure.<br />
We hope that its lesson will be learned.<br />
Punitive measures have not been ruled out.</p>
<p>-Anonymous</p>

<p>Citizens of the Internet,</p>
<p>Last year we faced our greatest threat from lawmakers. We faced down SOPA, PIPA, CISPA and ACTA. </p>
<p>And we won! </p>
<p>But that victory did not come easily. Nor did it come without a price. </p>
<p>Aaron Swartz was one of the leading voices in the fight against these idiotic and destructive efforts to control the last free space on Earth. </p>
<p>Aaron Swartz was persecuted. Now Aaron Swartz is dead.<br />
Tonight, the President of the United States will appear before a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address and tomorrow he plans to sign an executive order for cyber-security as the House Intelligence committee reintroduces the defeated CISPA act which turns private companies into government informants. </p>
<p>He will not be covering the NDAA, an act of outright tyrannical legislation allowing for indefinite detention of citizens completely outside due process and the rule of law. In fact, lawyers for the government have point-blank refused to state whether or not journalists who cover stories or groups the Government disfavors would be subject to this detention. </p>
<p>He will not be covering the extra-judicial and unregulated justifications for targeted killings of citizens by military drones within the borders of America, or the fact that Orwellian newspeak had to be used to make words like &#8220;imminent&#8221; mean their opposite. </p>
<p>He will not be covering Bradley Manning, 1000 days in detention with no trial for revealing military murders, told that his motive for leaking cannot be taken into consideration, that the Government does not have room for conscience. </p>
<p>He will not be covering the secret interpretations of law that allow for warrant-less wiretapping and surveillance of any US citizen without probably cause of criminal acts, or the use of Catch-22 logic where no-one can complain about being snooped on because the state won&#8217;t tell you who they&#8217;re snooping on, and if you don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re being snooped on, you don&#8217;t have a right to complain.</p>
<p>We reject the State of the Union. We reject the authority of the President to sign arbitrary orders and bring irresponsible and damaging controls to the Internet.<br />
The President of the United States of America, and the Joint Session of Congress will face an Army tonight.<br />
We will form a virtual blockade between Capitol Hill and the Internet. Armed with nothing more than Lulz, Nyancat and PEW-PEW-PEW! Lazers, we will face down the largest superpower on Earth.</p>
<p>And we will win!</p>
<p>There will be no State of the Union Address on the web tonight. </p>
<p>For freedom, for Aaron Swartz, for the Internet, and of course, for the lulz. </p>
<p>We Are Anonymous,<br />
We Are Legion,<br />
We Do Not forgive,<br />
We Do Not forget,<br />
Expect Us. </p>
