<p>Hello citizens of the world, we are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Dearest brothers and sisters it is time for a warning &#8211;</p>
<p>The global elite want to keep you poor and dependent. The financial crisis of 2007 to 2012 was just one salvo in the ongoing plan to keep the people poor and frightened. Recently it has come to our attention that the online spread betting industry is being used for these purposes.</p>
<p>Like pedophiles before them the gangsters of the gambling industry have infested the internet, several companies have collapsed, disappearing with all their customers&#8217; money. One such company was MF Global in the United States, which collapsed losing nearly a billion dollars. Another collapse was Worldspreads in the United Kingdom which had stolen 13 million pounds of customer money.</p>
<p>We are making this video to warn you that the next collapse will be Spread Co in the UK. Spread Co has been named in the British Parliament as being engaged in illegal employment and financial practices. The Parliamentary motion warns customers and investors of the substantial risk to their money. Spread Co has a heavy online presence but in reality it trades from a handful of rooms above some shops in a deprived area of London.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary motion reveals that Spread co has been making lay-offs since 2012. In 2012 Spread co lost 1.3 million pounds. Its own staff have filed a motion in Parliament complaining of its unethical practices. Nearly 10% of workers have brought lawsuits against the company. The main culprits are Ajay Pabari the Chief Executive, Matt Funnell the Head of IT and depraved manager Richard Pashley.</p>
<p>We all ask all concerned customers and investors of Spread Co to go to the Parliamentary website at the shortened URL showing now and read the motion carefully. Anyone who keeps their money in Spread co deserves a Darwin Award.</p>
<p>Spread Co, we Anonymous will not stand idly by whilst this evil happens. For the good of your customers, for the good of all mankind, and for our own pleasure we shall proceed to expel you from the internet and systematically destroy Spread Co.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
Expect us</p>
