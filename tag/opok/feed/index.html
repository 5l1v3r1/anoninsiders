<p>Greetings citizens of the world,</p>
<p>This is an urgent message concerning the absolutely devastating impact of the tornadoes that left a trail of destruction through Oklahoma on 5/20/2013. A new Anonymous operation is being launched known as <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpOK" rel="nofollow">#OpOK</a> in an effort to assist with the clean up/recovery effort. There is no limit to who you can help or what you can do. However we ask that you please do something. Many Anons and other humanitarian groups will be on scene to help in anyway we can.</p>
<p>This is an operation that all can assist with and if money, transportation, or any other issues that hinder you from being able to help get in the way, please at least use social media, video, and any other means to KEEP the word moving. As we have seen with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OccupySandy" rel="nofollow">#OccupySandy</a> the impact of individuals helping with natural disasters can be tremendous… So please assist in any way you can. WE ARE LEGION and WE have the ability to assist in helping those suffering on the ground. All possible help is needed, so please help if you can.</p>
<p>Immediate needs include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>Non-perishable donations from nearby communities.<br />
Ready-to-eat meals, canned goods, and water are vitally needed.<br />
Snack items such as peanuts, dried fruit, granola bars, etc.<br />
Gas for generators, Jerry Cans for holding fuel, and generators themselves may be needed soon.<br />
Socks, underwear, t-shirts, etc.<br />
Bandages and basic first aid supplies.<br />
It would be useful to pack supply kits in backpacks so people can transport them as needed.<br />
Coolers are also needed. (There’s never enough coolers to keep food chilled.)<br />
Especially important items also include: First aid supplies, gloves, hand sanitizers,<br />
diapers and wipes, tampons, batteries of all typical sizes, and flashlights.</p>
<p>For information about Community / Government operations on the ground and donation drop off points, as well as other useful information such as housing locations, please visit the Pastebin post linked in the description below!</p>
<p>We are Anonymous,<br />
We are Legion,<br />
We do not Forgive,<br />
We do not Forget,<br />
Expect Us.</p>

<p>Other helpful links for victims:</p>
<p>**Drive   only if necessary and avoid flooded roads and  washed out bridges.  Stay  off the streets. If you must go out watch for  fallen objects;  downed  electrical wires; and weakened walls, bridges,  roads, and  sidewalks.<br />
Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.</p>
<p>**Walk carefully around the outside your home and check for loose power lines, gas leaks and structural damage before entering.</p>
<p>**Stay   out of any building if you smell gas, floodwaters  remain around the   building or your home was damaged by fire and the  authorities have not   declared it safe.</p>
<p>**Inspect   your home for damage. Take pictures of damage,  both of the building   and its contents, for insurance purposes. If you  have any doubts about   safety, have your residence inspected by a  qualified building  inspector  or structural engineer before entering.</p>
<p>**Use   battery-powered flashlights in the dark. Do NOT use  candles. Note:  The  flashlight should be turned on outside before  entering &#8211; the  battery  may produce a spark that could ignite leaking  gas, if present.</p>
<p>Watch  your pets closely and keep them under your direct control. Watch out for wild animals, especially poisonous snakes. Use a  stick to poke through debris.</p>
<p>**Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it&#8217;s not contaminated.</p>
<p>**Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.</p>
<p>**Wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up to avoid injury.</p>
<p>**Use the telephone only for emergency calls.</p>
<p>**NEVER  use a generator inside homes, garages, crawlspaces, sheds, or similar   areas, even when using fans or opening  doors and windows for   ventilation. Deadly levels of carbon monoxide can  quickly build up in   these areas and can linger for hours, even after the  generator has  shut  off.</p>
