				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings. We are Anonymous. Operation Abuse Awareness has begun.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to the news, you will hear stories about both men and women being abused, physically and sexually. In the past few months, I have read over a dozen personal stories of people who have been abused, and in almost every single case the perpetrator walks away scott-free, leaving the victims to their terrible memories.</p>
<p>Any forms of abuse, whether it be physical, sexual, or verbal, are never acceptable. Thousands, perhaps millions, are abused annually, all over the world, while only a small fraction of the abusers get punished. This is not okay. Someone who values another human&#8217;s life so little shall not be permitted to ruin those innocent lives. We cannot let these criminals go unpunished. We will fight for justice. We will be there for the victims.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpAbuseAwareness" rel="nofollow">#OpAbuseAwareness</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpAA" rel="nofollow">#OpAA</a>) is going into action to do exactly what it says; raise awareness about the vast amounts of abuse going on in the world.<br />
We will do everything in our powers to help victims of any abuse and serve justice to do those who abused them.<br />
We will: Support the victims. Listen to their stories and show them our support.<br />
Expose the people abusing others.<br />
Help through fundraising, I&#8217;m hoping that we will be able to raise money to donate to places such as Rape Crisis Centers, support groups, and other places that will assist this victims through the hardships.</p>
