<p>We are Anonymous and this is Operation Cyber Privacy.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, we have launched and executed a series of cyber protests targeting both Canadian and American Servers with a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, also known as a D-DoS attack. Much to our surprise and displeasure, the servers dropped in a matter of seconds. While many of us disagree with how Canada&#8217;s and United States of America&#8217;s governments run, it is their responsibility to ensure the protection of the citizens. Sites that are crucial to the public, such as medicare, income tax and data storage along with national defense easily and quickly knocked offline. While we chose to keep the sites down for only a specific amount of time, in order to prevent citizens from being harmed by lack of access, the fact of the matter is that we had the ability to keep them down indefinitely. It would have had major impacts on the citizens if these websites were kept offline for weeks on end and we believe the people of a nation should not be accountable for their governmentâ€™s failures.</p>
<p>The ease with which we executed this sheds some insight into the theory that this legislation is actually required to protect government websites and sensitive information. Even after our first protest, they did not implement security measures for the websites. These bills serve only to increase surveillance on the citizens rather than help protect websites from cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s cyber security agency was equipped with infantile online protection and it was shocking how quickly we were able to disable them entirely. With much warning and a virtual blueprint of their vulnerabilities, they barely upped their game for our second round exactly 14 days later. This is an agency sitting on a 58 million dollar budget increase this year alone.</p>
<p>The United States was only slightly better prepared for us. Still, we were able to bypass the majority of their security in a short amount of time. Had we desired to put more effort in, we could have easily bypassed all of their security measures to take their site&#8217;s down for as long as we wished as well.</p>
<p>While we will not abuse this power, there are other hackers out there who will. They will bring down the sites for an extended amount of time, they will steal and dump personal information and put citizens at risk. This is why it is urgent for both governments to increase the security of the websites. If this attack had been perpetrated by the wrong person or was part of a state attack, just how badly could this have turned out?</p>
<p>Again, we would like to state that we stole no information or data from any of the sites. Any individual or group who took and dumped information in protest of the bills acted on their own and had no coordination or collaboration with this operation. We continue to stand by our conviction that personal data should not be collected, stored or shared without consent.</p>
<p>Armed with a true understanding of the intent of cyber bills and the abundant failures of the officials tasked with enforcing them, we can only hope that more people are able to look at this legislation in an objective way. Ask yourself how cyber legislation has helped to protect or prevent any of our three direct attacks. Ask yourself if you are prepared to exchange your privacy and access to free and open information for the illusion of security. Ask your self if the duty of protecting you and your information should fall to those whom do not only fail to understand the problems at hand, but are more importantly, too incompotent to protect your privacy, rights and data. If your answer is yes, then ask yourself why. If your answer is no, then join us. Get angry, stand up, fight back and disobey.</p>
<p>We are standing firm in the face of these laws in every country and are preparing for further action online and on the ground. We will not stand down until these laws are voted down, repealed or amended to best suit the needs, desires and freedoms of the people of the world.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
They really should have Expected Us</p>
