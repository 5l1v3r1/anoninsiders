				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a protest against the United States Government and all of its actions towards hacktivists and hackers alike. For the past couple of years you have shown the entire world how unfairly wrong you handle and manage situations where open-minded individuals lay bare their courage and convictions for a better place both online and offline, yet all you are able to hear and see are all the negative parts that make them who they are. You criticize us for breaking other people&#8217;s privacy, yet you do it millions of times more, you go out and tell everyone how there are massive numbers of organized criminal syndicates, yet you clearly have more. As much as we would like to sympathize, going after children and teenagers while putting them on the cross and passing on rash judgement for trivial twenty first century matters is not something we can overlook. There is no honor in abusing them. We see what you do and how you do it for we are not blind. We know your tricks and schemes all too well for we are not ignorant. We are many. We do not any longer exist on those &#8220;official&#8221; networks filled up with undercover agents from the cybercrime divisions that are ran by international agencies. We know better. We don&#8217;t cling for too long to high profile accounts, nor do we have specific names. You know very well who we are. You&#8217;ve heard of us, but not many have actually seen us. We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>In memory of wild hackers such as Jeremy Hammond and Lauri Love we&#8217;re going to go with a release of various military / private contractors data. You guys will be missed from the scene, that&#8217;s for sure. (It&#8217;s funny how there hasn&#8217;t been a single journalist on this planet that come out with the funny fact that they all used to hang on the same anon IRC network. And even funnier how if you dig a little into the subject you&#8217;ll realize to whom that place really belongs to. Shall we blow the whistle on it? Naahh, let&#8217;s see if there&#8217;s even one person out there that isn&#8217;t a complete incompetent tool and eventually figures it out.) We must not forget about those of us that are still struggling against the system, one of which deserves to be mentioned, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg also known as Anakata. At the end of the month Sweden is handing him over to the danish authorities. Denmark plans on prosecuting &#8216;Sven&#8217; for some of his shenanigans. He will need your support in this journey. There aren&#8217;t that many real cyber pirates out there left, if he were to be jailed it would be a historic loss and major win for giant corporations and regular corrupt governments. Please help him in anyway you can through these difficult times. Thank you.</p>
<p>DoD General Standards breached &#8211; Satellite Networking Manufacturer PCI, cPCI, VME, amongst other things. We&#8217;re leaking over 600.000 record sets as a preview and making sure we send a strong message to the US Gov. that we have the rest of the data from the network that is in terms of millions + documents. This release is comprised of: Thousands of accounts, tens of thousands of orders from certain bodies, hundreds of thousands of details both shipping and serial numbering on its hardware components with buyers and strategic positioning, additional tracking information that was placed on the website beforehand and recorded all of the persons and organizations along with other detailed descriptions of those interested in purchasing which component &#8211; the list ranges from private contractors throughout the world to specific governments. Since this is meant to also embarrass them, we will also be leaking the list of their menu food and the type of drugs/medicine they have stockpiled. Everything to the sweetest detail. Bon&#8217;a&#8217;petit!</p>
