				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of our bravest heroes and activists are now in jail and they need your help. Just for a moment, close your eyes and think about going to jail for years. Being isolated from your family, friends, lover and supporters. Imagine in this loneliness how valuable receiving a letter with loving words, a drawing from an admiring child, photos from hot loving chicks or news from supporters can be.</p>
<p>To the arrested activists, it means difference between sanity and insanity, between life and death, between a burning hope of freedom or despair.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they need you! And it&#8217;s simple as writing a letter.</p>
<h2>What should I write about?</h2>
<p>Your day, the weather, general news, funny stuff from the web and TV. Also, it&#8217;s good to ask them generic questions like where they are from, what stuff they like, what kind of music they enjoy, what&#8217;s their favorite TV show, etc.</p>
<h2>What can I include with my letters?</h2>
<h3>Pictures</h3>
<p>Most of the facilities do not allow photo paper. So print them on regular paper. Send pictures related to general news topics, cute animals, outside landscapes, etc.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>This is a wonderful form of expression and communication. If you send them art of your own, it holds especially high value. Even drawings from your kids is great!</p>
<h3>News articles</h3>
<p>Inmates often have very limited access to outside news, so anything you send helps keep them connected with the outside world. Try to find news related to a topic they like or place they are from.</p>
<h2>What should I never, ever write about?</h2>
<h3>Their legal cases</h3>
<p>Not only can discussing their case can hurt them legally, but it is also all they ever think about. They need communication that offers them a break from that.</p>
<h3>Drugs, violent, sexual or criminal topics.</h3>
<p>If you do, their mail will simply not get to them.</p>
<h3>Anonymous</h3>
<p>Many of the defendants on our list are being prosecuted for their perceived involvement with Anonymous and are not allowed any contact with Anons. By extension, please don’t send them photos of Guy Fawkes masks or other Anon symbols.</p>
<h3>Political affiliations with activists</h3>
<p>Similarly, other defendants are being prosecuted for perceived political affiliations. We recommend not discussing their politics in letters.</p>
<h2>What else should I know?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prisoners do not get the envelope. Include your name/nickname in the letter itself and an address they can write to if you would like a response.</li>
<li>Keep the number of paper sheet to a minimum. Most only allow 6 or less. Check with the facility.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t include stamps or money in your letter. You need to donate to the commissary. Some facilities might have exceptions.</li>
<li>Stickers, glitter, glue, and other fun stuff is prohibited. Paper and ink only.</li>
<li>Almost every facility has a website. Go to the website of each facility to see what special rules they may have before you write.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keep writing</h2>
<p>If you don’t get a response, keep writing. Sometimes mail doesn’t make it to them, they don’t have money for stamps that week or they just don’t feel up to writing back. Your letters are still important. If they write back, consider it a bonus.</p>
<h2>Find who to write to</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://freeanons.org/">FreeAnons</a> group keep an <a href="http://freeanons.org/resources/mail-the-arrested/">updated list of arrested information activists and their addresses</a>. Pick someone you know and want to support. If you don&#8217;t know any then pick one and check them out on Wikipedia.</p>
<h2>Donate via the commissary</h2>
<p>You need to contact the facilities, probably by phone, and ask them how you need to proceed.</p>
<h2>About law enforcement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: red;">All letters are read by the facility staff. They most likely will be copied and stored for further use by them.</strong></li>
<li>A real full name and return address are required on the envelope.</li>
<li>Your name might end up on some law enforcement watch list.</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is the closing argument given by Jeremy Hammond’s Attorney, Sarah Kunstler, in Jeremy’s court case last week:</p>
<p>In December of 2012, 24,000 geophysicists gathered at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. The most well-attended lecture was about the depletion of the earth’s resources. A geophysicist name Brad Werner from the University of California walked the crowd through an advanced computer model to show how the rapid depletion of these resources was leading to the destabilization of the earth’s ability to sustain human life.</p>
<p>When asked what could reverse or stem this tide, Mr. Werner was largely at a loss. There was one dynamic in the model, however, that offered some hope. Werner termed it “resistance” – movements of “people or groups of people” who “adopt a certain set of dynamics that does not fit within the dominant culture”. According to the abstract for his presentation, this includes “protests, blockades and sabotage by indigenous peoples, workers, and other activist groups.” Serious scientific gatherings don’t usually feature calls for mass political resistance. But in the history of our great nation, and in the history of human kind, there have always been moments where resistance has led to important change. The American Revolution. The Civil War. The Civil Rights Movement, and end of Apartheid in South Africa. And there have always been people who have stood up to make that change. Our founding fathers, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>What these people have in common is how they act in a moment of choice, when confronted with a situation in which they can rise up, often at great personal risk, and take action, or quietly sit down, and risk nothing. And in that moment of choice, if they do nothing – no one will be the wiser. But if they act, they will suffer the consequences of that action.</p>
<p>These actors and the actions they take are not always understood in the moment. Sometimes, the actors are viewed as criminals, their actions, as violations of the established law. Sometimes, it takes time – days, decades, a century – for the context and meaning to be properly understood. And in some cases, history, rather than vindicating them, will judge them harshly.</p>
<p>The development and use of surveillance technologies will be one of the defining issues of our times. The reach of these capabilities is astonishingly broad: governments can listen in on cell phone calls, use voice recognition to scan mobile networks, read emails and text messages, censor web pages, track a citizen’s every movement using GPS, and can even change email contents while en route to a recipient. They can secretly turn on webcams built into personal laptops and microphones in cell phones not being used. And all of this information can be filtered and organized on such a massive scale that it can be used to spy on every person in an entire country. Jeremy Hammond, a gifted computer programmer, decided to use his skills to break the law. He did so out of a concern that these technologies were enabling governments and corporations to gather information on individuals and organizations without oversight or scrutiny. He did so as an act of protest. And as a result of his actions – and the actions of others similarly committed to open government – the public has become increasingly aware and increasingly concerned.</p>
<p>There are many – like our adversaries in the United States Attorney’s office – who do not accept Jeremy Hammond’s actions as acts of civil disobedience; many who see what he did as one dimensional, criminal and malicious. In its sentencing submission, the government argues that Jeremy Hammond “was motivated by a malicious and callous contempt for those with whom he disagreed,” and that his goal, demonstrated by statements that he made in chat rooms, “was to cause ‘mass mayhem’ by destroying the websites of entities he disliked.” Contrary to the government’s representations, this wasn’t a malicious and unfocused act against an entity with whom Jeremy had a disagreement – it was an act of protest against the private intelligence industry and its ability to do what the United States, in theory, is prohibited from doing – targeting American citizens and other populations worldwide.</p>
<p>If Jeremy spent every waking hour online, hiding behind a screen, hacking into websites, it would lend credence to the government’s argument. But this is not the case. Jeremy Hammond lived an active, moral and productive off-line life as well – a life in which he was devoted to helping others – in a way that many of us imagine we would do – if only we had the time. In an age where technology and computers isolate us – where we walk around staring into tiny screens, use social media to stay in touch with friends, and send text messages rather than talk to the people in our lives, Jeremy<br />
connected with people, looked them in the eyes, and made an impact on their lives in extraordinarily positive ways.</p>
<p>The government discounts these efforts. In a footnote buried deep in its submission, the government argues that Jeremy’s contributions to the public good are not worthy of this court’s consideration because they are “substantially outweighed” by the harm he caused. The government ignores the letters of support we received – 60 out of a total of 265 – from people who know Jeremy from his positive work in the communities of Chicago – people who have first-hand knowledge of the countless hours he devoted to volunteering, teaching/tutoring, creating a community space so groups could meet, organizing to close down local coal plants that were poisoning his neighbors, helping people gain skills, find jobs, and get back on their feet, opening the doors of his home to people who were hungry and in need, and inspiring others to do these same things. These letters demonstrate a profound accomplishment and a profound commitment to humanity, far greater than any of us at the defense table can lay claim to. And under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), they are certainly worthy of the court’s consideration.</p>
<p>One of the most wonderful letters attached to our submission came from someone who has never met Jeremy. A father of two young people attending college in Chicago, who wrote after his children made him aware of Jeremy’s case. This man’s children were not friends of Jeremy’s either – he happened to run into them on the street, when they were moving their belongings up three flights of stairs into a new apartment. Jeremy happened by, and offered to help. Later, after his arrest, they saw his picture on the news and realized that the person who had helped them was the person who now awaits sentence in this case.</p>
<p>This is by no means the most significant letter in our submission. But I mention it because it highlights the kind of person he is. Not many people would have stopped to help. But Jeremy Hammond is the kind of person who stops everything he is doing to help another human being. A person who has made a tremendous real-world impact, and a person who feels the responsibility to make the world a better place, in big ways and small.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hammond broke the law. He knew that he was breaking the law, and he acted at his peril. He accepts the consequences of his actions. He does not – and we do not – minimize his actions by addressing his motivation. But his motivation matters. When Jeremy sat down at his computer and broke the law, he did so with the same set of values and principles that he applied to every aspect of his life. Nothing that Jeremy did in this case was for personal gain. Had it been otherwise, he surely would have sought to exploit the credit cards available to him – something he has never done. In a recent statement, Sarah Harrison, the British journalist who accompanied Edward Snowden to Russia, described actors like Jeremy Hammond as the last line of defense in the fight for transparency.</p>
<p>Ms. Harrison wrote: In these times of secrecy and abuse of power&#8230; When whistleblowers come forward we need to fight for them, so others will be encouraged. When they are gagged, we must be their voice. When they are hunted, we must be their shield. When they are locked away, we must free them. Giving us the truth is not a crime. This is our data, our information, our history. We must fight to own it. The government has a one dimensional view of this case. Part of the challenge may be that Mr. Hammond’s actions are a new form of protest, using tactics that are concededly violations of our federal criminal laws for a higher purpose. But our world is changing quickly, as evidenced by the hundreds of letters of support – and thousands of people who signed on to the petitions – that we submitted to the court.</p>
<p>Your honor, Jeremy understands that you must sentence him today, and that you must apply the laws in force at this moment. None of us has the benefit of history, hindsight, or the changes that will not doubt take place as our thinking and our laws evolve to address the seemingly boundless use of surveillance by corporations and governments and the actions of people like Jeremy Hammond, who step forward to grasp truths that are hidden from us. Under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), we respectfully submit, that after looking at all of the sentencing factors – Jeremy Hammond’s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence, and to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, that a sentence of time served is sufficient but not greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The Anonymous Solidarity Network: FreeAnons in the UK! We will not forget Ashley Rhodes, Christopher Weatherhead (Nerdo), Jack Davis (Topiary), Ryan Ackroyd (Kayla) and all arrested Anons in United Kingdom and around the world.</p>
<p>The Anonymous Solidarity Network exists to provide legal, financial and moral support for activists facing prosecution for involvement, alleged or otherwise, in Anonymous actions. The use of information networks to perform community acts of protest is neither a crime nor an act of conspiracy and should not be prosecuted as such. We believe that information is power and that the power should always belong to the People. We dedicate ourselves and our resources to helping activists combat injustices of law arising from the fight for freedom of information and positive social change.</p>
<p>In cooperation with information and cyber-activists, legal advisors, and the People, the Anonymous Solidarity Network acts to advance the cause of Anonymous through organizing public awareness programs, campaigning charitable efforts and providing legal assistance. Inspired to action by the unjust prosecution of our friends and family, the Anonymous Solidarity Network strives tirelessly to implement the critical initiatives required to advance, commemorate and preserve the activism of Anonymous and the cause of freeing Anonymous activists from unjust prosecution.</p>
<p>The storm has yet to pass and what ships remain out at sea are desperately seeking refuge from the relentless waves of prosecution but there is one ship sailing towards, not away from, these troubled waters. We are the Anonymous Solidarity Network. We are a collective of Anons and the friends and family of Anons facing prosecution for alleged involvement in Anonymous activities. Our ranks are not exclusive and we have no leaders. Any can join us and all are welcome to contribute to our direction. For us to continue our voyage, however, we need your support.

<p>Hacktivism is based on ideologies: free flow of information, transparency or how you wanna call it. Hacktivism is <b>NOT</b> damaging. It is a way to expose the lies. Thats the problem . . .  problem for politicians, governments, banks, corporations etc. They can not accept And that&#8217;s why they are treating hacktivists like terrorists. </p>
<p><b>Hacktivists are not terrorists.</b></p>

<p>FreeAnons  is launching <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, which is an effort to send incarcerated  Anonymous, activists, and political prisoners Valentines. As a society,  the most ominous question that Anonymous actions ask to all of us,  techies and techtards is: when doing solely what is legal stops to be  moral? That is for you, the reader, to answer. Many Anons and activists  dare crossing the line. Of course the Corporate State will spin its own  yarn for popular consumption which will be repeated by the usual status  quo mouthpieces. It seems unavoidable, since Socrates was condemned to  drink hemlock, that those who hold the power try to reframe our  experience, making us doubt our own heart and our own conscience.  What  cannot be doubted is that these people never committed a violent crime  and never acted for personal profit but out of moral conviction.  Their  engagement comes loaded with possible consequences. Many have already  been arrested and are serving jail sentences for having the courage to  stand. With <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, we want to remind Jeremy, Christopher, Josh,  Barrett and all the others that they may be behind bars, but they are  not left behind as long as we stand with them and for them.

<p><strong>FreeAnons is happy to support <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpValentine" rel="nofollow">#OpValentine</a>, which is an effort to send incarcerated Anonymous, Activists, and Political prisoners Valentines.</strong> Separated from their friends, their family, all of their love ones, many of our brothers and sisters will be deprived of this most basic human right. They have sacrificed their freedom to expose corruption and human rights violations.</p>
<p>And as would say Che: “At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love.” So, Valentine day is a most appropriate occasion to share in their spirit and remind them, that their isolation is only physical. They are not alone, not forgotten and we stand with them and care.</p>
<p>For more, and the list of addresses, please see <a href="http://piratepad.net/8Qw5sIeMae">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>This op is done in conjunction with <a href="http://nato5support.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/send-your-love-to-our-incarcerated-comrades/">Nato5support: </a></em><br />
<em> <strong>“We are reclaiming this arbitrary day and using it for our own purpose – to send messages of love to those incarcerated for political reasons. They are locked away from their loved ones and need our support on a mid-February day, as well as every other.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks to AnonSikko and Nato5support for organizing this op, and working so hard to spread the word.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are Citizens of the United States of America October 26th 2012 4:30 Bryant Park NYC</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/enemiesofthestate" rel="nofollow">&commat;enemiesofthestate</a> Now that Julian Assange has been declared an enemy of the state for revealing to the world the lies of the US government, we Americans who value truth and freedom will stand up in solidarity with Wikileaks, Assange, Manning, The Paypal 14, and all political prisoners who have used their voice to reveal the truth and express their opinions, we proclaim that we are all enemies of the state.</p>
<p>It is important that everyone realize that the persecution of Manning, Anonymous, Assange, and wikileaks marks a dangerous time for our constitutional rights. We must speak out now, or else we may not have another chance. As the laws tighten around the necks of free speech and free Journalism people like Manning and Assange give us hope that their are still people willing to risk everything so citizens of the world can know the truth and make their own judgements.</p>
<p>As Free people we should all exercise our rights to speak and demonstrate freely without fear of retribution from our governments, and show those that would keep us blind and ignorant of the truth that we will not take it anymore.</p>
<p>We will rally at Bryant Park where there will be a talk given by <a href="http://www.alexaobrien.com/timeline_us_versus_manning_assange_wikileaks_2012.html">Alexa O&#8217;Brien about wikileaks</a>. There will also be a talk given by Stanley Cohen (istanleycohen.org), Chase Madar (author of &#8216;The Passion of Bradley Manning&#8217;), and a performance by the team from &#8216;Bradass87&#8217;. After this, the march will begin. | enemiesofthestate@interoccupy.net</p>
<p>We the free people of the United States call upon everyone to march with us in solidarity, to organise rallies, talks and marches to tell those that wish to suppress our voice that we stand in unity together for all our imprisoned brothers and sisters. We are free. We will be heard. We are not afraid. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23enemiesofthestate" rel="nofollow">#enemiesofthestate</a></p>

<p>Barrett Brown, activist, author and non-elected spokesperson in various mainstream media interviews regarding Anonymous operations and activities was raided last night while conducting a live video stream using the TinyChat video-cast service [1].<br />
In the last week, Barrett Brown has authored a stream of twitter post and uploaded a series of videos to YouTube in which he expresses anger towards the FBI and a particular agent as a result of a raid which occurred last ? during which we was arrested at his mother’s residence. This raid was in conjunction with the arrest of 25 members of alleged hacker group Lulzsec.</p>
<p>Following the release of these videos, in which Barrett Brown makes various threats against the FBI in general and a certain named agent in particular, he posted a log purporting to show SMS and email conversations between an alleged informant, Jen Emmick, and an FBI agent – <a href="http://pastebin.com/12crnMjP">http://pastebin.com/12crnMjP</a> | <a href="http://pastebin.com/LtadDiFC">http://pastebin.com/LtadDiFC</a>.</p>
<p>Speculation continues as to what specifically prompted the present raid and arrest as charges are yet to be pressed. Common theories are threats against an FBI member and his family, as well as the release of information including the above conversation logs.<br />
Whether the timing is mere coincidence or the result of sufficient evidence to justify a raid following the recent posts remains to be answered.</p>
<p>Barrett Brown loved to appear on TinyChat to talk to Anons and people from all around the globe. Was the FBI watching this TinyChat session, which had been ongoing for some time when the raid occurred, awaiting an opportunity to catch him red-handed?<br />
At time of writing, it was been over 12 hours since the raid and no sources of news or confirmation have been given about the incident, excepting twitter posts by an account connected with Barrett Brown’s legal representation, California attorneys Leiderman and Device – <a href="https://twitter.com/LeidermanDevine">https://twitter.com/LeidermanDevine</a>.</p>
<p>The terrifying wall of silence erected by law enforcement serves no purpose other than the keep the arrest out of the media cycle and to inspire e far and intimidation in his friends, loved ones and supporters who are justifiably concerned about his well being and anxiously await updates on his legal status. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElviraXMontana/status/246181604131758080">https://twitter.com/ElviraXMontana/status/246181604131758080</a></p>
