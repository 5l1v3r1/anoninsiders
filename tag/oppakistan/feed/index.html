				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings citizens of the world,</p>
<p>The people of Pakistan live in a country ravaged by war and where essential natural resources such as water are becoming scarce. On top of their corrupted and dictatorial government, officials are killing innocents protesters and anti-government activists. Pakistani voices are now united against the injustices they have suffered for years. They are revolting.</p>
<p>Since the protest started on the August 15th over 500 Pakistanis were injured, 2550 were arrested and at least 20 were killed by law enforcement and military forces. They have used tear gas and rubber bullets to their content in order to massacre and kill innocent people.</p>
<p>Anonymous is watching you Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, law enforcement officers and government officials. At this very moment, our hacktivists are gathering information about the violent crimes you are perpetrating against your citizens. No government can hide its violence and corruption behind a wall of secrecy and silence. Like all governments, we know you fear the power of informed citizens united to create a more just and peaceful world. Welcome to the global revolution!</p>
<p>To the Pakistanian revolutionaries, you have our support. We will help you set up secure communications and avoid government surveillance, censorship and control. You will have the power to show the world what is really going on, without having to fear for your life.</p>

<p>Anonymous has watched in horror with the world as non-violent protesters from Palestine to Ferguson have been gassed, beaten, shot at and arrested this summer. And we have done everything in our power to intervene and protect them, and collect the evidence of the human rights violations perpetrated against them. But when protesters are killed; gunned down in the streets, and shelled with military grade mortars &#8211; Anonymous will, as it has in the past &#8211; remove that government from power.</p>
<p>We are cataloging the atrocities being committed in Pakistan. We will begin at once assisting the peaceful protesters in Pakistan with every tool and tactic at our disposal. And we will initiate the process of removing every vestige of the Pakistan government from the Internet and shutting down their communications network. And the Pakistani people will then remove this criminal regime from power and lock them in prison where they belong. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you are hereby dismissed. You will leave power immediately. For the safety and security of your family we suggest that you depart Pakistan at once. This is your only warning.</p>
<p>As for the criminal security and military forces who have so barbarically attacked your own people in Pakistan, we will collect evidence of your crimes and deal with you in the time and manner of our choosing. You would do well to&#8230;.well, you know &#8211; expect us. You will either answer to the justice of your people and the international community, or you will be the subject of the rage filled vengeance of Anonymous.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous<br />
We Are Everywhere<br />
We Are Legion<br />
We Do Not Forgive<br />
We Do Not Forget</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it is to late to Expect Us.</p>
