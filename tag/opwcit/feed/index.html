<p>Citizens of the world, we are Anonymous</p>
<p>Since we invited you to show our fellow citizens that our privacy matters, you made several times <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpBigBrother" rel="nofollow">#OpBigBrother</a>&#8217;s voice surround in many countries and paperstormed efficiently to inform people about the threats of surveillance systems on our fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>We know all of you participating, found the good way to make information flow. Thanks to all for your hard work in the preparation of those days of action. You proved that most of the people didn&#8217;t know anything about the future surveillance society that is being drawn with projects like INDECT or Trapwire because media stay silent on those matters.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we know that information on all those projects are hidden, or, when they are publicly available, all is done to make the people unable to understand without deep investigation on documents related. All that shows only a will to prevent people from understanding the true consequences of such things on their lives.<br />
We, as Anonymous hacktivists, engaged <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpBigBrother" rel="nofollow">#OpBigBrother</a> because we want every citizen on the planet to know that the surveillance state is unecessary to our security as citizens.</p>
<p>We would also like to make the people understand, that systematisation of technological surveillance and control on everything is dangerous for the safety of Human Rights.</p>
<p>We continue to believe that technology has to serve humanity and we do hope many of you worldwide will agree.</p>
<p>Privacy that <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpBigBrother" rel="nofollow">#OpBigBrother</a> defends, mainstream media, the developement of technology and entertainment made we forgot it since the last decay, maybe earlier.<br />
That Right, if it falls, makes all other Rights of a structure called Freedom to crumble.<br />
We invite every organization working for privacy and every citizen to continue to inform people on the threats that hang over privacy.</p>
<p>Governments pretend to design those systems for security reasons, but every people able to access and understand information on those matters will stand up against a society of global control on the citizens that is being drawn.</p>
<p>They plan to use technology to know everything about citizens including : who is who, who do what and with whom, as well in real life and the Internet.</p>
<p>Some government and private companies prepared to control people with the a new Internet regulation treaty. USA and Europe rejected the text but will it be the same on the next meeting ? Be ready to defend your privacy again in 2013 with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opWCIT" rel="nofollow">#opWCIT</a>. Be careful on how governments and private companies will try to share them the control of the Internet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to act, it&#8217;s time to show the governments of the World, who we are, it&#8217;s time to show humanity stands as united, it is time to show what freedom means to us.<br />
We call on you to prepare for the next Day of Action against surveillance planned.</p>
<p>Act now and spread the word in your mother tongue, enter your Countries and Cities, in the pad linked on the description of this video once you can organize things : <a href="https://pad.riseup.net/p/OpBigBrotherORGA">https://pad.riseup.net/p/OpBigBrotherORGA</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s our Freedom and our privacy.</p>
<p>Resist and build together, because we are the sons of the Resistance</p>
<p>Let us unite the whole humanity as one.<br />
Let it be the largest protests of the world history.</p>
<p>United We Stand, Divided We Fall.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous,<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you all know the UN is working on international proposals and it might turn for the worse for our Internet freedom. Some people as made <a href="http://wcitleaks.org/">WCITLeaks</a> as a public service to allow anyone to send the proposal anonymously for all to read. It&#8217;s totally awesome, clear and well built.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the mission stated on their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>The forthcoming <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/default.aspx">World Conference on International Telecommunications</a> is marred by a lack of transparency. Access to preparatory reports, as well as proposed modifications to the ITRs, is limited to ITU member states and a few other privileged parties. This leaves civil society groups, and the public in general, in the dark. To foster greater transparency, we are offering a way for those in possession of such documents to make them publicly available. They can be anonymously <a href="http://wcitleaks.org/#upload">submitted to us</a>, and we will publish them here.</p></blockquote>

It's called the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), and it's being organized by a government-controlled UN agency called International Telecommication Union (ITU). If some proposals at WCIT are approved, dcisions about the internet would be made by a top-down, old-school government-centric agency behind closed doors. Some proposals allow for access to be cut off more easily, threaten privacy, legitimate monitoring and blocking online traffic. This must be stopped. Only governments get a vote at WCIT, so we need people from all around the world to demand that our leaders keep the internet open. Sign the petition on : https://www.google.com/takeaction/.
