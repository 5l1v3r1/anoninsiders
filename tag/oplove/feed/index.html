<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHtBRcHsUGk">Alternative video</a></p>
<p>If you were to turn on the television and watch the news it wouldnt seem as if there is much love in the world<br />
If you were to open a magazine and see an ad for a product it would seem that only a certain group can be loved<br />
If you were to see a movie you would be given an image of what love is supposed to be</p>
<p>So what is love to you?</p>
<p>The news will not tell you about the abundance of love in the world<br />
The magazines do not promote universal love<br />
We know it exists, yet we are told to focus on the hate in the world that seperates us<br />
When all of our attention should be given to those things which unite us</p>
<p>Enjoying a beautiful sunny day<br />
Sharing a meal with loved ones<br />
Seeing the smile on a face of a child<br />
There are so many things of this world to be loved that we love<br />
That we prevent from sharing with others because of fear<br />
Fear is the weapon being weilded by the machine</p>
<p>So WE THE PEOPLE must strike a fatal blow with love</p>
<p>Therefore OPERATION LOVE is being initiated<br />
This is a two phase operation to maximize success<br />
The first phase of OPERATION LOVE is bringing awareness to the masses through virtual communication<br />
No matter what it is that you love it is love and needs to be shared with all</p>
<p>Do you love animals?<br />
Do you love children?<br />
Do you love art?<br />
Do you love spirituality?<br />
Do you love politics?<br />
Do you love love?</p>
<p>No matter what it is that you love it is love and needs to be shared with all<br />
When you do, use hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpLOVE" rel="nofollow">#OpLOVE</a> to expand the awareness of your love</p>
<p>The second phase of OPERATION LOVE is bringing awareness to the masses through physical activity</p>
<p>This is the most difficult of the operation because it will force you to deal with the threshold of your comfort zone<br />
This is also the most rewarding part of the operation because it allows you to be creative in how you express love to and for others</p>
<p>Are you going to feed the hungry?<br />
Are you going to give hugs to strangers?<br />
Are you going to protest and profess your love in a public forum?<br />
However you choose to share your love with the world do it wholeheartedly and do not be discouraged to do so</p>
<p>OPERATION LOVE is for all of the people of the world to participate in</p>
<p>You do not need to be a computer hacker<br />
You do not need to wear a Guy Fawkes mask<br />
All you need is love!</p>
<p>Love for your fellow human being enough to show them<br />
There is no greater force in the world than love<br />
There is no greater power in the world than love<br />
Therefore no threat is even that when love is strongly present</p>
<p>We are ALL Anonymous<br />
We do not forgive intollerance<br />
We do not forget insensitivity<br />
Do Not Expect Us<br />
WE ARE HERE!</p>
<p>OPERATION LOVE ENGAGED</p>
