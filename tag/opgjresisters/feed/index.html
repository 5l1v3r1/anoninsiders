<p>Greetings; we are Anonymous. It has recently come to our attention that the FBI, local police and the Department of Homeland Security are now and have been engaged in acts of espionage against US citizens. Their only reasoning for doing this is they feel threatened by their own citizens. It is clear that they would not feel this way if they were acting appropriately in the first place. With so many new laws enacted in the past 10 years that slowly but surely eat away at our rights and freedoms as human beings, such as NDAA and the USA Patriot Act, it should be no surprise that there has been a rise in activism within the citizenship. That in itself is a right protected by our Constitution and Bill of Rights that they so callously spit upon every day.</p>
<p>On May Day, 2012, in the city of Seattle, there was a large demonstration, as there is every year supporting workers’ rights. As usual, there were supporters of other causes on scene and a large contingency of black bloc. They caused the usual destruction to banks, storefronts and also to an old federal courthouse building. This story, of course, was blown way out of proportion. Even though there was a large amount of damage done, it was only done by a small group within the black bloc. While Anonymous does not inherently condone destruction and violence, we also do not speak against it. It is up to the individual and/or groups to decide upon tactics that they use to get across the point that they are trying to voice. We understand that many of us in the world today feel powerless against the machine and railing against it with words can feel ineffectual. It is then that many turn to “violence”, though many will say smashing out a window is not exactly an act of violence as there is no harm directed toward any people.</p>
<p>There were many individuals targeted by the police and federal officials following that day for the actions and an investigation and a federal secret Grand Jury was launched to find those responsible so they could be brought to justice… or so they say.</p>
<p>There is one big problem with the story that is being told regarding that though. That grand jury was already put together long before the May Day ‘riots’.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 25th, the FBI conducted a series of coordinated raids against activists in Portland, Olympia, and Seattle. They subpoenaed several people to a special federal grand jury and seized computers, black clothing and anarchist literature. This comes after similar raids in Seattle in July and earlier raids of squats in Portland. Though the FBI has said that the raids are part of a violent crime investigation, the truth is that the federal authorities are conducting a political witch-hunt against anarchists and others working toward a more just, free, and equal society. The warrants served specifically listed anarchist literature as evidence to be seized, pointing to the fact that the FBI and police are targeting this group of people because of their political ideas. Pure and simple, these raids and the grand jury hearings are being used to intimidate people whose politics oppose the state’s agenda.</p>
<p>Additionally&#8230; <a href="http://www.anonpaste.me/anonpaste2/index.php?23cfab127e018789#D3Cfp8YbFyeYnGGdTqSXxNT2eBvD2tgzA1pP9fvwxDc=">THIS EMAIL PROVES</a>, THEY HAD THIS PLANNED BEFORE THE ACTIONS IN SEATTLE MAYDAY.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons and others, including this quote:</p>
<p>“An FBI surveillance team, followed five of the suspects north from Portland when they drove to Olympia the day before the May first riots.” the FBI agent told the court.</p>
<p>Anonymous has created Operation Grand Jury Resisters. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpGJResisters" rel="nofollow">#OpGJResisters</a> We shall do what we do in support of these brave individuals who are standing up so strongly against a corrupt system they are willing to sit in a federal prison in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Events will be planned each Monday and secondly each additional day that OpGJResisters makes an announcement that there is another court date, or, that there is an action planned by other activists in that area.</p>
<p>It is highly important that these sites are rendered inaccessible, firstly each Monday and secondly each additional day that OpGJResisters makes an announcement that there is another court date, or that there is an action planned by other activists in that area.</p>
