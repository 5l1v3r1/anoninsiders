				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now is our chance to increase the pressure on Capital Hill, if you are a citizen of the world that is concerned about the impact of the Cyber Information Sharing Protection Act then you should read this and take some action. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are from the United States or not, this bill will directly result in your privacy being invaded should you EVER use a web service that is hosted in the United States. If these persons in the Government hear enough noise they will back down and withdraw support. You are our only hope of accomplishing this.</p>
<p>Please help us all by helping yourself.</p>
<p>Please begin calling/faxing on the morning of Friday April 26th 2013, at 9 am eastern time (06:00 PDT 13:00 GMT)</p>
<p>That way as soon as the staffers are getting into the office, trying to get coffee etc, they are forced to answer phones for several hours and field questions about this bill and it&#8217;s provisions and answer why or why not the Senator is able to voice support or opposition.</p>
<p>Tweeting isn&#8217;t getting the attention we need, calling and faxing will.</p>
<p>Read the complete information on <a href="http://www.anonpaste.me/anonpaste2/index.php?5325c26425e696dd#Axomqjg3r19D4GrfRvt6BewIGVTiPk3GJmBNyvRQgCI=">AnonPaste.me</a></p>
