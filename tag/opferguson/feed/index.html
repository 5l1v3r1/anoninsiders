				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anonymous Operation Ferguson &#8211; Press Release: &#8220;Operation Take Down&#8221; Initiated</p>
<p>Tuesday &#8211; November 24, 2015  11:00 AM ET USA</p>
<p>The Anonymous team of Operation Ferguson watched with horror as a group of highly armed white supremacist terrorists opened fire on the Black Lives Matter protesters at the 4th Precinct occupation in Minneapolis, Minnesota &#8211; gravely injuring at least five innocent protesters. These men wore bullet proof vests, covered their faces &#8211; and had been watching the occupational protest at the 4th Precinct for days. This was a planned terrorist attack by organized white supremacists. And it&#8217;s not the first in recent memory, as earlier this year nine innocent black people were slain by a white supremacist gunman in their own church in South Carolina&#8230;.WHILE THEY PRAYED!</p>
<p>The MPLS police responded to the shooting of innocent protesters in front of their precinct house NOT by offering aid or assistance, but by further brutalizing them with mace and batons. And the MPLS police will answer to us for this crime at a time and by a method of our choosing. The white supremacist movement in the USA however is a different story. From this moment forward Anonymous declares itself to be at war with these domestic terrorists. We will hunt you down, expose you &#8211; and destroy your lives. We will remove your social media accounts and other online assets from the Internet. We will bring to bear against the white supremacists in the USA the same exact tools and tactics that have been so successfully deployed this past year by Anonymous against ISIS and other jihadists. If you are a white supremacist in the USA, your time is up &#8211; and your doom is upon you.</p>
<p>For this Operation we will consult with and use the same template as the Anons and other hacker crews in Op ISIS have utilized so effectively against terrorists already. We will begin with a &#8220;Report A Racist&#8221; feature on an Op Take Down page which will be available by the end of today on our main website &#8211; www.OperationFerguson.cf</p>
<p>We will join forces with our sister Op, Operation KKK. We will use the crowd sourced data we obtain through this process of reporting to investigate these individuals and assets, determine if they are indeed white supremacist related &#8211; and then target these individuals and assets through cyber attacks, public exposure &#8211; and the removal of their accounts from the Internet. We will especially expose police or political leaders who have any ties to white supremacy. We will find these animals, expose them &#8211; and destroy their lives. As we did in Op KKK, we will eventually provide our vetted data on all white supremacist organizations and individuals in the USA to the various domestic anti-hate group NGO&#8217;s who make it their business to monitor these terrorists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Operation Take Down&#8221; will be managed by the team of Anonymous Operation Ferguson. We encourage those who want to support or assist us in this fight against domestic terrorists, as well as interested journalists &#8211; to visit our website and follow our Twitter. Just as it does in Op ISIS, it will take all the effort of the entire Anonymous Global Collective to crush these terrorists. If you are an Anon or un-affiliated hacker, please join us.</p>
<p>This is war. We have long experience in destroying white supremacists in the USA. If you are a white supremacist it&#8217;s too late to expect us. We suggest you run as fast as you can, and hide. Because we will show you no mercy when we find you.</p>

<p>In this past week the USA has witnessed some truly epic moments in the history of civil rights in this country. Some were joyous, some were tragic &#8211; and some were heroic. From President Obama&#8217;s stirring eulogy to the Reverend Senator Pinckney, to the nationwide celebration for the LGBT community of the historic SCOTUS decision &#8211; to the now iconic images of Bree Newsome, a courageous young black woman &#8211; climbing a pole in front of the South Carolina State Capital and removing the Confederate Flag. </p>
<p>But as the President said in his moving eulogy, the work is not done. And the flag, a symbol of hatred and oppression &#8211; coming down is just the beginning. There is much more work to be done. And we must do this work together. Shoulder to shoulder. White, black, brown, red and yellow. Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and atheist. Democrat, Republican, and Green. Socialists, Anarchists and Environmentalists. And while Anonymous agrees with the President of the United States that the Confederate Flag coming down for good in front of the South Carolina State Capital is just a small yet important beginning &#8211; it is a NECESSARY beginning. And one that has yet to occur.</p>
<p>On this day, we witnessed the incredible courage of Bree Newsome, a young black activist and organizer &#8211; bravely climb up that pole in front of the South Carolina Capital while quoting bible verses and remove herself what the legislature should have already removed long ago &#8211; that reviled symbol of hate and subjugation of black Americans. We believe that this historic act of civil disobedience MUST be honored, and in a way befitting such an amazing act of courage.</p>
<p>And so Anonymous, in conjunction with the Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements &#8211; hereby calls forth a Million Person March for the only day when it could possibly happen, Independence Day. We call on every American of good conscience to make their way to Columbia, South Carolina and march with us to the State Capital. We will sing hymns of praise, we will honor the fallen, we will feed each other, we will love each other. And together with a million voices and fists raised to the heavens we will demand one thing: The Flag Must Come Down!</p>
<p>WITH LOVE  &#8212;  Anonymous</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday &#8211; October 29, 2014  9:45 PM ET USA</p>
<p>For the past year LocalLeaks has been dormant, the web-based disclosure platform taken down from the Internet. We will discuss the reasons for this in a moment, but we would like to announce that this hiatus is now over and the premier disclosure platform LocalLeaks has been re-loaded and re-launched at the Top Level Domain www.LocalLeaks.info and we are now accepting, processing, analyzing and publishing leaks on local government, businesses and police once again.</p>
<p>The ostensible reason for re-launching LocalLeaks was a specific request from operatives in Anonymous Operation Ferguson ( <a href="http://www.OperationFerguson.cf">www.OperationFerguson.cf</a><br />
&#8211; Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/OpFerguson" rel="nofollow">&commat;OpFerguson</a> ). It seems they have been receiving an ever growing volume of leaks from the St. Louis area regarding the situation there in Missouri, and felt that we would be better equipped given our work dealing with the massive leaks in Steubenville, Ohio during Anonymous Op RollRedRoll &#8211; to deal with these new disclosures about Ferguson. Indeed the now famous &#8220;Steubenville Files&#8221; that were so instrumental in bringing justice and reform to that city are still viewable on our website.</p>
<p>The operatives in Anonymous Operation Ferguson have already transferred to us all material that has been leaked to them to date, including the recently published leaks regarding the Grand Jury decision and Darren Wilson, published here -> http://pastebin.com/CJ5ipU7W</p>
<p>Also forwarded to us by Anonymous Operation Ferguson is a sizable body of material that has not been analyzed or published yet. In the coming days we will process this material and set up a section on the platform called the &#8220;Ferguson Files&#8221; where we will continue to add new material as it is leaked and analyzed by our volunteer staff. All future Ferguson related leaks will be handled by us, and we encourage anyone in Missouri with pertinent information or sensitive/secret data or documents to leak them to us.</p>
<p>LocalLeaks is an incredible and historic disclosure project. Even our sister organization WikiLeaks has commented often on our work. However, much like WikiLeaks &#8211; it is an expensive platform to maintain long-term. That is the reason we had to shut down for the past year, a lack of funding. So if you support the broad ideals, purpose and work of LocalLeaks &#8211; please consider a generous donation. There are several ways to donate already on the website and we will be adding more options as we move forward. Anyone of means wishing to become a serious benefactor should contact us and we will put you in touch with our legal team to make the arrangements.</p>
<p>We are delighted to be back, and we can not wait to begin serving not only the great people of Ferguson, Missouri &#8211; but the entire world, by providing a place where people can leak important information on their local governments, businesses and police.</p>
<p>SINCERELY  &#8212;  LocalLeaks Staff</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of Missouri continues to ignore the demands of the people for reform and justice. And so the time has come to take our fight to the next level. We hereby call a Statewide General Strike in Missouri this Friday August 29th for one day. The theme for the action will be &#8220;Hands Up &amp; Walk Out&#8221; and includes both workers and students, who are encouraged to take the day off &#8211; not to mention the long Labor Day weekend, to organize and protest across the State of Missouri.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning. If the righteous demands of the people and Anonymous are not met, the General Strikes will continue, become longer &#8211; and will be expanded to include the entire USA. This is no longer about &#8220;no justice, no peace&#8221; &#8211; now it&#8217;s about &#8220;no justice, no profit&#8221;. There will be reform and justice and an end to the killing or we will together shut down the entire country.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous &#8211; We Are Everywhere &#8211; We Are Legion &#8211; We Do Not Forgive &#8211; We Do Not Forget</p>
<p>This Friday, Expect Us again.</p>

<p>Greetings citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>In recent light of the situation in Ferguson Missouri, where the people&#8217;s right to protest has been usurped by an illegal curfew and the deployment of the national guard, we&#8217;re committed to stand hand in hand with the people in Ferguson, where peaceful protesters have been arrested, journalists threatened and the right to protest criminalized. Using jammers to disrupt communication of livestreamers, letting plumb rule the streets like dictators in the middle east to hurt people, no-fly zone: in a word &#8220;a military force&#8221; will not ensure peace and justice in Ferguson.</p>
<p>Jay Nixon, this is not democracy, this may be your right but not your right to fight us and that&#8217;s what why the dosage of online and offline protest will continue, and even grow. By now you have most likely experienced the helplessness as a governor. Your efforts to pervert the law, to censor the truth will continue to fail at great cost to you just as your attempts to paint our peaceful demonstrations as riots. The internet certainly will help the citizens to protect themselves from any attack by your militarized police.</p>
<p>Social media has changed the rules of your game. That&#8217;s why we call the people, on you; students, activists, parents, the youth and the wise, people from different backgrounds to protest peacefully with Ferguson this weekend, in order to achieve this goal our collective will be ready to assist you in reaching this goal.</p>
<p>To the people of the United States, its time to wake up, not to sleep. Your constitutional rights as a citizen have been usurped. People have the right to protest, and that right has been consistently disrupted not by the protesters in Ferguson &#8211; but by the militarized police force.</p>
<p>Our campaign has been one of constant success, we have been able to weaponized social media so far to force mainstream media outlets to cover the case. We advise everyone to join us on twitter, other social networks and the internet because the revolution of our conscience will not be televised.</p>

<p>A little over 24 hours ago in Ferguson, Missouri &#8211; USA the Ferguson Police Department shot an un-armed teen 6 times and killed him. His body was left to lie in a pool of blood in the sweltering heat for hours while the police militarized the area against protesters and attempted to concoct a reasonable story as to why they snatched this innocent students life for no reason. The St. Louis County Sheriff Department even sealed the roads leading to Ferguson in a vain attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the city.  His name was Mike Brown, he was 17 &#8211; and he would have started college next week. Instead, his family is struggling to come up with funeral costs.</p>
<p>The entire global collective of Anonymous is outraged at this cold blooded murder of a young teen. Not a week goes by that some young person, usually of minority ethnicity &#8211; is slaughtered by murderous police in the USA. For this reason Anonymous will not be satisfied this time, as we have in the past &#8211; with simply obtaining justice for this young man and his family. Anonymous demands that the Congressional Representatives and Senators from Missouri introduce legislation entitled &#8220;Mike Brown&#8217;s Law&#8221; that will set strict national standards for police conduct in the USA. We further demand that this new law include specific language to grant the victims of police violence the same rights and prerogatives that are already enjoyed nationwide by the victims of other violent criminals. The Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution demands nothing less.</p>
<p>To the good people of Ferguson, take heart &#8211; and take your streets. You are not alone, we will support you in every way possible. Occupy every square inch of your city. Open your homes and help in any way you can the protesters who will come to your city from every part of Missouri and the USA. Businesses and householders that are near protest rallies, open your WiFi routers so that live streamers and other independent journalists can use the Internet connections. Feed each other, keep each other safe &#8211; and stay in the streets until we are totally victorious in all our demands.</p>

<p>To the Ferguson Police Department and any other jurisdictions who are deployed to the protests: we are watching you very closely. If you abuse, harass &#8211; or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web based asset of your departments and governments off line. That is not a threat, it is a promise. If you attack the protesters, we will attack every server and computer you have. We will dox and release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse. We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet. This is your only warning.</p>
<p>The time has come for more than simple justice for these atrocities. The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say &#8220;no more dead kids&#8221;, no more police killings and beatings. Anonymous is drawing a line in the sand, and that line runs right down the middle of Main Street Ferguson, Missouri. Police impunity ends with the barbaric death of Mike Brown.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous<br />
We Are Legion<br />
We Will Not Forgive<br />
We Will Not Forget</p>
<p>EXPECT JUSTICE<br />
DEMAND CHANGE</p>
