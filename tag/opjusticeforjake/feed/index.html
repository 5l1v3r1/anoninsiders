				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>In a bittersweet event, Jacob &#8216;Jake&#8217; Limberios was reburied this afternoon. The tears of Anonymous join those of the Limberios family. We fervently hope that Jake will now finally be allowed to rest in peace. This family has buried their son 3 times, this is too much for anyone to bear. Yet through it all, the courage and dignity of the Limberios family continues to stand as an example for all of humanity. If the Sandusky County justice system has a shred of decency left within it, this will be the final time.</p>
<p>We, the citizens of Sandusky County, and the World, have read the latest email demands and threats directed towards the family, Dr. Wecht, and Attorney McGookey. While the demands made may appear reasonable on the surface, they become much less so when one knows the history of the case. In the eyes of the World the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s office is now beginning to appear heartless, petty, and vindictive, as well as potentially incompetent. Do you not believe this family has been through enough that you might consider one of the compromises which have been suggested rather than sticking, shall we say doggedly, to your &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; approach? A bit of humanity and understanding might go a very long way.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is not cross-country from Ohio; why not let your doctor travel there to view the samples? Surely in view of the scope of this public relations disaster a couple tanks of gas should not be considered a big issue? How much more bad press will this case get in the time it would have taken you to have her simply go look at the samples? The first national media article has already been published; how long before it becomes a flood? We fail to understand your decision making process.</p>
<p>On that subject, Anonymous wishes to thank the news media for their solid and unbiased coverage of this issue. We look forward to continuing to work with you until the conclusion of this tragic story.</p>
<p>Anonymous continues to believe that this entire issue can be quickly and simply worked out. We believe that justice for Jake Limberios is not only within reach but is eminent. Please do not let the details obscure the goal.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Today we wish to address several concerns in the Jake Limberios case. First, as you know, a video was released, purportedly from Anonymous. While it is possible that this video was created by an Anonymous member, it was not created or released by this operation, OpJusticeForJake. All official releases will be announced by the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpJustice4Jake"><a href="https://twitter.com/OpJustice4Jake" rel="nofollow">&commat;OpJustice4Jake</a></a> Twitter account. We will have nothing further to say on this topic.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are hearing rumors regarding the status of the Sandusky County inquiry into Jake&#8217;s death. We have heard that the county is asking the Limberios family and Dr.Cyril Wecht to turn over their portion of the samples to the county. We wonder why this would be needed? Half of each sample was provided to the county following the original autopsy performed by Dr. Wecht. Has Sandusky County perhaps lost or misplaced their portion of the samples?</p>
<p>Finally, we know the timeline of events in this case, therefor we have the &#8216;what&#8217;. We know the persons involved, therefor we have the &#8216;who&#8217;. We are left wondering however, as to the &#8216;why&#8217;. Why were witness statements taken as fact without investigation? Why was no proper forensic investigation conducted immediately after the incident? Why was no autopsy conducted immediately after the incident? Why did the family have to pay an expert to do the county&#8217;s job? Why did it take a lawsuit to move county officials to act? Why are clear conflicts of interest being ignored?</p>
<p>Is it a matter of overworked officials? Is it a matter of simple incompetence or is there something more nefarious involved? Investigations continue on this question. When we have the answer, and we will have it, it will be publicly released.</p>
<p>In closing we wish to direct your attention <a href="http://youtu.be/oDgp8rniNsE">to a video released by a group known as Justice Sandusky</a>. This is an excellent video detailing many of the points which need to be clarified. </p>
<p>We continue to hope that Sandusky County will step up to the plate and complete this investigation in a proper, if belated, manner.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.<br />

The Honest Support Us.<br />
The Heroic Join Us.<br />
Expect Justice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Greetings,</div>
<div></div>
<div>It has come to our attention that threats have either been made or are perceived to have been made against one or more public officials. The purpose of this release is to denounce any and all threats of violence. Anonymous is a peaceful entity. We do not make threats of violence and we do not participate in or condone acts of violence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We have seen instances in the past where threats were made by local individuals for whatever purposes and these threats were attributed to us. We are trying to ensure that this does not happen here by denouncing any and all threats of violence early on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To be clear, Anonymous has not made threats of violence. Anonymous will not make threats of violence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Recently a police officer&#8217;s personal phone number was apparently released by persons unknown. We regret this. While we do sometimes release personal information, a procedure known as D0xing, we have not reached that point in this case. We hope and fully expect not to.</div>
<div></div>
<div>At this point in time we are simply watching to see what officials are going to do with the results of the current inquiry. We fully expect justice to be served. If this happens, as we expect, we will quietly fade away. If this does not happen, further investigations will commence. In any case, there will be no violence nor threats of violence towards any persons or property from Anonymous.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That is all</div>
<div></div>
<div>We Are Anonymous.</div>
<div>The Corrupt Fear Us.</div>
<div>The Honest Support Us.</div>
<div>The Heroic Join Us.</div>
<div>Expect Justice.</div>
