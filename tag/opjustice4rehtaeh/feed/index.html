<p>Greetings worlds we are Anonymous, </p>
<p>Anonymous call for ANOTHER peaceful rally will be held in front of Police Headquarters in the continuation of seeking JUSTICE for the Parsons family following the TRAGIC death of their 17-year-old daughter Rehtaeh.<br />
We are rallying for the following demands:</p>
<p>1) We DEMAND the HRP release an update to ensure the public they are continuing work on the case and to demonstrate their progress.</p>
<p>2) We DEMAND The Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Services, specifically the Crown Attorneys&#8217; Office, issue a statement on the progress of this case, to explain why there have been no arrests to date, and when the public can expect charges to be laid.</p>
<p>3) We DEMAND an Independent public inquiry into this case that is transparent to include all government departments that should have or could have helped Rehtaeh. Inclusive of : The Capital District Health Authority, Capital District Mental Health Services, The IWK Mental Health and Addictions Program, The Administration of Cole Harbour High School, The Nova Scotia Department of Justice, The Halifax Regional Police Department, The Crown Attorneys&#8217; Office, The Nova Scotia Department of Education, The Nova Scotia Department of Health, and The Office of the Premier.<br />
We EXPECT open, honest reports detailing where mistakes were made, which departments failed, and proposed changes and remedies that will occur to ensure this NEVER happens to another victim.</p>
<p>4) We have held back releasing the names of the accused with the best of intentions and hoped the wrongs would be righted. We have allowed you time and the opportunity to realize Justice for Rehtaeh, the Parsons&#8217; family and friends.<br />
If these steps are NOT taken, ALL information will be released in this case.Our patience has grown thin and nearing its END. After this rally, if there is no action or results, We PROMISE the next release will be the information on ALL involved.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do NOT forgive;<br />
We do NOT forget,<br />
EVER<br />
Expect us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>April 2013 -Special Edition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1687" alt="OpJustice4Rehtaeh Protest" src="http://anoninsiders.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/opjustice4reh-protest.jpeg" width="634" height="475" /></p>
<p>This is the sad story of another girl who <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/rehtaeh-parsons-suicide-amanda-todd/">saw her life destroyed by rapists</a> in the small community of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. Literally destroyed when she took her own life. Turns out Anonymous does not take kindly to rape and cyberbullying and <a href="http://anoninsiders.net/opjustice4rehtaeh-pr-1268/">the collective grabbed its Sherlock Holmes cape</a>. The game was afoot very briefly. They were allegedly able to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/anonymous-claims-have-identified-rehtaeh-parsons-alleged-rapists-launches-opjustice4rehtaeh-1186479">identify the rapists in 24 hours</a> and told the police they could help.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/466583/teen-killed-herself-after-sex-assault-mother/">the police didn&#8217;t like it at all</a>&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/04/12/rcmp-commissioner-bob-paulson-says-he-is-open-to-working-with-hacker-group-anonymous-as-long-as-they-unmask-themselves">Police</a> : &#8220;If Anonymous want to work with us then they better drop their masks.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/322795807214563331"> Anons</a> : &#8220;If the police want to work with us then they better put on a mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lulz" rel="nofollow">#lulz</a>!</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t like it? So what! Let&#8217;s push it further and organize a <a href="http://anoninsiders.net/anonymous-of-halifax-re-parsons-protest-1337/">protest in front of their HQ</a>! YAR!</p>
<p>So the story continues in Halifax, <a href="/opjustice4rehtaeh-halifax-demo-1305/">during the demo</a> caught by <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/31468555">livestreamers</a>. Protesters chanted &#8220;Cops, do your job.&#8221; while <a href="http://www.twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/323490779442073601">Tim Horton was giving free coffee to the protesters</a>. Even <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8vY_vNXWXfMJ:https://twitter.com/DBCOOPA/status/322756696810332161+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nl&amp;client=ubuntu">Rehtaeh&#8217;s mother was there</a>. The public was afraid that we screw up but the operation team did a great job and put up the <a href="http://anoninsiders.net/update-on-opjustice4rehtaeh-1429/">most amazing PR I ever saw</a>. Big <a href="https://twitter.com/YourAnonFancy/status/323487006581735424/photo/1/large">GuyFawkes hug</a> to all anons on the team and supporters.</p>
<p>In the end we <a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/justice-for-rehtaeh-demand-an-independent-inquiry-into-the-police-investigation">got our private indy investigation approved</a>, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/457695/20130416/rehtaeh-parsons-suicide-anonymous-rape-nova-scotia.htm">the case reopened</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/mt_ept/stories/2013/04/24/rehtaeh-parsonss-family-has-heartfelt-talk-with-harper.html">Rehtaeh&#8217;s parents meet the Prime Minister</a> and  <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/457695/20130416/rehtaeh-parsons-suicide-anonymous-rape-nova-scotia.htm">Rehtaeh&#8217;s father thanked us</a>. Even the <a href="http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/rcmp-worried-posters-in-rehtaeh-parsons-case-could-incite-vigilantism-1.1243651">Halifax school board is to be reviewed</a>. HAHA! Then we were called many things: v<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/vigilantes-or-heroes-how-anonymous-is-reshaping-its-image-with-the-rehtaeh-parsons-case/article11211575/">igilantes or heroes</a>? Whichever suits you best folks! Both are fine with us.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/04/15/ns-stolen-antiques.html?cmp=rss">police may still busy itself recovering 2,000$ of stolen dolls, cologne and after-shave</a>, but at least the Nova Scotia Minister of Justice Ross Landry, after some coaxing from <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/11/see-you-sunday-anonymous-issues-new-cryptic-warning-in-attack-on-n-s-justice-minister-over-lack-of-charges-in-rehtaeh-parsons-case/">your Anons truly</a>,  seemed to have a sudden <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1122616-landry-it-s-never-too-late-to-do-the-right-thing">change of heart</a>. Anyone feel like PR consulting?</p>

<p>Greetings from Anonymous.</p>
<p>Please be aware of the following facts:</p>
<p>1) One of the alleged rapists has made several public statements admitting that he did have sex with Raetaeh on the night in question. He admits she was inebriated at the time, also that she was throwing up during the act.</p>
<p>2) During his confession, he names three other boys and admits that they too took turns having sex with Rahtaeh that night as well. The names match with those we have confirmed during our investigation.</p>
<p>3) The individual making this confession is the same boy identified in the photograph. He has also admitted to being in the photograph and named the accomplice who took the picture.</p>
<p>4) All information, including screen shots of the confession, have been made available to the police.</p>
<p>5) Two boys have been implicated repeatedly whom we believe are innocent based on numerous testimonies given by individuals with first hand knowledge of the surrounding events.</p>
<p>6) There are multiple witnesses who were classmates of the alleged rapists that can confirm they were shown the photograph of Rehtaeh by them.</p>
<p>7) At the very least, there was a house with a minimum of half a dozen underage students consuming alcohol and engaging in sexual intercourse. What happened in this house resulting in the spread of child pornography. This much the police will agree to. No charges have been filed in regards to this.</p>
<p>Why is Anonymous involved in this case? We are involved because the facts above clearly illustrate that several crimes have been committed in Nova Scotia. A 17-year-old girl killed herself because the police failed to do their jobs and charge a single person for any of them.</p>
<p>Is it necessary for Anonymous to be involved in this case? Yes. For a moment lets set aside the theatrics, the masks and the labels. We are group of concerned citizens that have recognized an injustice in the system. We have taken it upon ourselves to point out that injustice to the public and we are asking the police to correct their incompetent handling of this case&#8211;a young girl has already died from it.</p>
<p>An image of a 15-year-old girl having sex was viral in Cole Harbour District High School. Neither the school nor the police dispute this. By legal definition that image was child pornography. By some estimates, hundreds of individuals have already seen the photograph, including many adults. The police have seen the photograph. The fact that this evidence was disregarded as inappropriate for any kind of arrest by the police is unconscionable.</p>
<p>What the police are saying to the citizens of Nova Scotia is clear: Having underage students drinking and having sex in your home is not a crime in our community. Photographs of 15-year-old girls having sex is not child pornography, but if it is, the distribution of that child pornography is not a crime. A 15-year-old girl is capable of giving her consent to sex even after she is inebriated to the point that she vomits while hanging out of a window&#8211;it is not sexual assault.</p>
<p>We urge the RCMP to act like guardians , set the proper example for the young men of Nova Scotia and send a clear message: This behavior will not be tolerated in our communities. The women and young girls of Nova Scotia should not have to live in fear or be forced to hide evidence of a rape because they will be called whores.</p>
<p>As we have previously warned, the identities of these individuals have already began to circulate online independent of our own actions. We have done our best to keep those names from being released. Two young men are being implicated in a crime we know they did not commit. Is it illegal for us to release their identities and let the world know that they are innocent? What justice will be made available to them once their names are slandered throughout the world and for all time?</p>
<p>It is not for the police to decide the facts presented here do not constitute a crime. That is the responsibility of a jury. A claim of sexual assault has been made. There is photographic evidence of it. There is an admission that child pornography was distributed throughout the community. One of the individuals who should be charged hasn&#8217;t even disputed these facts. We are asking&#8211;no, we are demanding: Let a jury decide. Follow your own procedures and protect the innocent.</p>
<p>We do not seek vigilante justice. If those who we believe are guilty are exonerated in a court of law, Anonymous will disappear from Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>If we decide to release the names a deadline will be declared at least one week in advance.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are legion.<br />
The honest support us.<br />
The corrupt fear us.<br />
The heroic join us.<br />
Expect us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anonymous of Halifax would like to thank the collective at large for working diligently to bring the eyes of the world upon our community. Without your help, there would be no justice for Rehteah Parsons.</p>
<p>However, we must express our concern at the calls for protest scheduled this Sunday at 2pm in front of the Halifax Regional Police headquarters. This protest has been scheduled without consultation of the local collective, and thus has no organizers.</p>
<p>We fear that many in the collective at large misunderstand Halifax as another Steubenville. You might not be aware that we have a vibrant activist community here. You might not be aware that we have an active Black Block, and militant anti-capitalist community. Without organization, this protest is merely an invitation for anyone who has beef with the RCMP and Halifax Regional Police to come express their anger violently.</p>
<p>Anonymous of Halifax has resolved to change this, to ensure the safety of our community and that the good name of Anonymous is protected. We pride ourselves on our positive relationship with the Halifax Regional Police, and unlike other groups we have worked and will continue to work closely with them. The Halifax Regional Police has had our back, protected us from harm, and acted in good faith as brokers of discussion for us in the past. Despite our disappointment with the local RCMP, these facts will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>To anyone planning to attend this protest: we welcome and encourage your attendance&#8230; but sully the name of Anonymous  or Rehteah Parsons through acts of violence at your own risk.  </p>
<p>Rehtaeh&#8217;s family has made very clear their desire for any actions to be an expression of love and tolerance, a characteristic of Rehteah&#8217;s nature. We ask anyone who plans to attend to keep this fact at the front of their mind. Anonymous demands Justice for Ray Parsons, not retribution.</p>
<p>Knowledge is our weapon. And it just so happens that knowledge is free.</p>
<p>We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us.</p>

<p>We urge the RCMP to act like guardians , set the proper example for the young men of Nova Scotia and send a clear message: This behavior will not be tolerated in our communities. The women and young girls of Nova Scotia should not have to live in fear or be forced to hide evidence of a rape because they will be called whores.</p>
<p>As we have previously warned, the identities of these individuals have already began to circulate online independent of our own actions. We have done our best to keep those names from being released. Two young men are being implicated in a crime we know they did not commit. Is it illegal for us to release their identities and let the world know that they are innocent? What justice will be made available to them once their names are slandered throughout the world and for all time?</p>
<p>It is not for the police to decide the facts presented here do not constitute a crime. That is the responsibility of a jury. A claim of sexual assault has been made. There is photographic evidence of it. There is an admission that child pornography was distributed throughout the community. One of the individuals who should be charged hasn&#8217;t even disputed these facts. We are asking&#8211;no, we are demanding: Let a jury decide. Follow your own procedures and protect the innocent.</p>
<p>We do not seek vigilante justice. If those who we believe are guilty are exonerated in a court of law, Anonymous will disappear from Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>If we decide to release the names a deadline will be declared at least one week in advance.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are legion.<br />
The honest support us.<br />
The corrupt fear us.<br />
The heroic join us.<br />
Expect us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from Anonymous,</p>
<p>As most of you are aware we have decided that it is best to withhold the names of the alleged rapists we have identified. We are doing this for two reason. Firstly, Leah Parsons, mother of Rehtaeh has asked us to. We feel that honoring the Parsons wishes while they lay their daughter Rehtaeh to rest is the respectful thing to do. Secondly, we are aware that new evidence may have possibly been presented to the RCMP. If this is true, nothing should interfere with that investigation. We would much prefer to see someone in jail than their only punishment to be shame. That would not be justice.</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that several names have already been posted online to various websites, even tossed around on Twitter. Be aware that 99% of you have named someone that is innocent. You may have gotten one name right, but all the good you think you are doing will be displaced by the harm you will cause to the innocent young men you have wrongly named. We urge you to be patient. If it&#8217;s a guilty party you&#8217;re looking for, look no further than the RCMP or the Cole Harbour School District.</p>
<p>So far we have not been in contact with any other group that can positively identifiy all four of the alleged rapists. So here is what we&#8217;ll do: If we decide to release the names they will go out on a pastebin. A message will be sent to Your Anon News exclusively confirming the validity of the post. Just know that if you are passing names around beforehand you are just as likely to implicate an innocent person as you are the real suspects.</p>
<p>We aren&#8217;t playing guilty until proven innocent. We apologize to those of you who want this type of justice, but bashing someone&#8217;s reputation online is just not good enough.</p>
<p>Attend our demonstration in Halifax this Sunday: April 14th (2PM ADT)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since yesterday morning several teams of investigators have been working to dissect the events surrounding the rape, harassment and suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons.</p>
<p>What we have learned is certainly appalling, but it wasn&#8217;t the act of rape that shocked us. It was the behavior of the adults in Rehtaeh&#8217;s life that we found most disturbing. Let&#8217;s set aside for a moment the compassion they should have shown as human beings and just focus on the responsibilities they had as professionals. We&#8217;re talking about the school teachers, administrators, the police and prosecutors, those who should have been role models in the late Rehtaeh&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>To begin, Ross Landry&#8217;s reversal of his decision not investigate this case after a media blitz is clearly an indication that his sudden interest is purely an act of public relations damage-control. You should be really ashamed of yourself. In contrast to your statements your actions are not genuine and your patronizing attention is unappreciated. Ross, you have zero class. We encourage you to get it together.</p>
<p>Now, it took us only a few hours to identify the boys that assaulted Rehtaeh. This wasn&#8217;t some high-tech operation that involved extracting private messages from someone&#8217;s Facebook account. Dozens of e-mails were sent to us by kids and adults alike, most of whom had personal relationships with the rapists. Many recalled confessions made by these boys blatantly in public where they detailed the rape of an inebriated 15-year-old girl. Recent statements by police and prosecutors that there simply wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to make a single arrest should be viewed solely as an admission of incompetence on their part. This wasn&#8217;t “he said, she said.” He said he did it and he said it to everyone while showing them a photo of him doing it. Every officer that signed off on this “no evidence” conclusion should be guarding the entrance to a petting zoo for the remainder of their careers. We&#8217;re afraid to ask if anyone even bothered to check the EXIF data on the rape/child pornography being openly shared by hundreds of students throughout your community.</p>
<p>The way the story is told, time and time again, these sad little boys had no fear whatsoever about admitting publicly their crimes and even spreading photographic evidence of it. Why were they unafraid? They believed no one was ever going to do anything to stop them and they were right. For this we point our fingers at the Cole Harbour school system. It is truly disturbing that this level of bullying could happen in one of your schools without you noticing. Worse, child porn was apparently viral in your halls and you had no clue. That was the excuse your staff repeated on the news yesterday wasn&#8217;t it, that you didn&#8217;t know. Well, it&#8217;s your job to know. If the administration of that school had any honor they would all resign for failing to meet the terms of their employment.</p>
<p>All of you have created a mess and instead of taking responsibility and cleaning it up, the first thing you did yesterday morning was get on television and defend your jobs. You have taught the young men in your community a terrible lesson: rape is easy.</p>
<p>And just to clear things up once and for all for the young men in Nova Scotia who are unlikely to hear this from any of their role models: vomiting drunk girls are not capable of giving you consent to have sex with them. That kind of sex is called rape. It isn&#8217;t really sex at all. If that&#8217;s the only way you can laid, you are pathetic and should stick to quietly sobbing while fondling yourselves in the dark until hopefully the day comes when some woman you probably don&#8217;t deserve pities you enough to teach you how to act like a real man.</p>
<p>At this time we can honestly say we&#8217;re confident we know the identities of the people involved in Rehtaeh&#8217;s rape. It would probably take us a lot longer to come up with a list of the people responsible for her death. We hope you all find some way to sleep at night.</p>
<p>See you Sunday.</p>

<p>Anonymous engaged <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpJustice4Rataeh" rel="nofollow">#OpJustice4Rataeh</a> this morning in response to the suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons. Justice Minister Ross Landy says that it is important for Nova Scotians to have faith in their justice system. Mr. Landy, justice is in your hands.</p>
<p>Anonymous has confirmed the identities of two of the four alleged rapists. We are currently confirming a third and it is only a matter of time before the fourth is identified as well.</p>
<p>Our demands are simple: We want the N.S. RCMP to take immediate legal action against the individuals in question. We encourage you to act fast. If we were able to locate these boys within 2 hours, it will not be long before someone else finds them. </p>
<p>We do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims. That would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob. What we want is justice. And That&#8217;s your job. So do it.</p>
<p>The names of the rapists will be kept until it is apparent you have no intention of providing justice to Retaeh&#8217;s family. Please be aware that there are other groups of Anons also attempting to uncover this information and they may not to wish to wait at all. Better act fast. </p>
<p>Be aware that we will be organizing large demonstrations outside of your headquarters. The rapists will be held accountable for their actions. You will be held accountable for your failure to act.</p>
<p>That is all</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous.</p>
<p>The Corrupt Fear Us.<br />
The Honest Support Us.<br />
The Heroic Join Us.<br />
Expect Justice.</p>

<p>Anonymous a démarré <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpJustice4Rataeh" rel="nofollow">#OpJustice4Rataeh</a> ce matin en réponse au suicide de  Rehtaeh Parsons. Le Ministre de la Justice Ross Landy dit qu&#8217;il est  important pour la Nouvelle-Écosse d&#8217;avoir foi en son système de justice.  Monsieur Landy, la justice est entre vos mains.</p>
<p>Anonymous a confirmé  l&#8217;identité de deux des quatre présumés violeurs. Nous sommes sur le  point de confirmer l&#8217;identité du troisième et ce n&#8217;est qu&#8217;une question  de temps avant que le quatrième soit également identifié.</p>
<p>Nos  demandes sont simples: Nous voulons que la RCMP de la N-É prenne des  actions légales immédiates contre les individus en question. Nous vous  encourageons à agir rapidement. Si nous avons été capables de localiser  ces gens en moins de 2 heures, cela ne sera pas bien long avant que  quelqu&#8217;un d&#8217;autre ne les trouve.</p>
<p>Nous n&#8217;approuvons pas la &#8220;justice  sauvage&#8221; comme le font entendre les médias. Cela voudrait dire que nous  approuvons les actions violentes menées à l&#8217;encontre des violeurs des  mains d&#8217;une foule déchaînée. Ce que nous voulons est la justice. Et ceci  est votre travail. Alors faites-le.</p>
<p>Les noms des violeurs seront  gardés secrets jusqu&#8217;à ce qu&#8217;il soit clair que vous n&#8217;ayez aucune  intention de rendre justice à la famille de Rehtaeh. Soyez avisé qu&#8217;il y  a d&#8217;autres groupes d&#8217;Anon qui tentent aussi de découvrir ces  informations et il se peut qu&#8217;ils ne désirent pas attendre. Vous devriez  agir rapidement.</p>
<p>Soyez avisé que nous organiserons une grande  manifestation sous vos quartiers généraux. Les violeurs seront tenus  responsables pour leurs actions. Vous serez tenu responsable de votre  manque d&#8217;agissement.</p>
<p>&#8211; We Are Anonymous</p>
