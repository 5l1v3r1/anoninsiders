<p>On December 15, Gabon is having municipal elections. Once more, ritual killings of children and others are being used by politicians who hope to increase their luck before elections. There is someone found dead and mutilated somewhere in Gabon every 1 to 2 days. The killing of young Catherine, 4 years old, in late October 2013 reminded us of the brutality of ritual crimes against children.The phenomenon has increased dramatically since President Ali Bongo&#8217;s fraudulent elections in 2009.</p>
<p>People of Gabon have asked corrupt President Ali Bongo, for too long, to do something about ritual crimes. He made promises to end them during a mock propaganda march with his wife in May 2013, in response to Anonymous pressure. Nothing has happened.</p>
<p>Ritual killings are fueled by elections and greed. People are killed and mutilated for elections that will be full of fraud anyway. In local elections taking place in Gabon, we see once again the refusal to create a transparent election. Many multiple listings were found in the electoral register. Gabonese challenged the presence of many foreigners as candidates in local elections. Many candidates are members of the Bongo family, including Ali Bongo&#8217;s mother. The Bongo family has been ruling Gabon for more than 46 years and their fraudulent elections are accepted by the international community.</p>
<p>Gabon is an oil rich country with one of the highest GDP&#8217;s in Africa, but over 80% of the 1.5 million Gabonese live below the poverty line. The majority make less than US $2 per day. According to Yahoo Finance, Ali Bongo and his associates pocketed 25% of Gabon&#8217;s GDP in the last 3 years with the help of his international supporters. In the meantime, Ali Bongo authorizes force with tear gas to be used against children of young as 10 years old, protesting for better schools and the return of teachers to class.</p>
<p>International oil, banking and infrastructure firms are supporting this terrible regime in Gabon: Total, Shell, Perenco, Tullow Oil, Sinopec, Vaalco, Citigroup, Bank of America, BGFI, Axa Insurance, Bolloré, Bouygues, Petrolin, Bechtel, New York Forum Africa, just to name a few. Some of the banks (Citi, HSBC, BOA) have been implicated in fraud and money laundering with the Bongo family and their friends. Accountants and lawyers in developed countries are helping as well.</p>
<p>All the big money and corruption is fueling ritual killings because those ordering the killings expect them to bring money and power. The United Nations, including UNICEF, is doing nothing to help children being slaughtered in Gabon. Gabon is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The UN is not doing enough to denounce ritual crimes publicly.</p>
<p>The people of Gabon are fed up. They are tired of being tortured and eaten by the very politicians who are stealing their livelihood. They are tired of the international community praising the Bongo regime for the benefits his greed brings to their corporations.</p>
<p>Anonymous has lost patience with the Bongo regime and his enablers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="620" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x-ZfZpfTqrU?list=UUuV5p2xMEv5RRe-ikY1tgqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The impunity for ritual killings continues in Gabon. Murders performed in a horrible manner, in order to harvest &#8216;spare parts&#8217; when victims are still alive are unpunished. The criminals are the people who rule the country. Body parts such as the sex, ears, tongue, eyes, heart, kidneys, blood, flesh and skin are sold to powerful people who are promised youth, health, wealth, promotion, success and especially honor and power, in exchange for the organs.</p>
<p>Since OpGabon was first engaged on April 13 of this year, the people of Gabon were boosted by Anonymous family support. They decided to have another march on May 11. But President Ali Bongo has changed his message and he is now recognizing the existence of ritual killings that he was still denying just a month ago. His wife, Sylvia Bongo has all of a sudden became an «activist» against ritual killings, profiting from the momentum created by Anonymous awareness to try to rebuild the tarnished image of the Bongo regime. She has attempted to co-opt the march for her own propaganda.</p>
<p>As the Collective of Women Against Ritual Killings puts it, these are the same people who denied a popular march on April 13 because they are known to be part of the problem. Politicians are well known sponsors of those crimes. This is the main reason why women&#8217;s groups, members of civil society and young music artists are organizing their own march apart from the one Sylvia Bongo has co-opted.</p>
<p>The Bongo regime knows Anonymous will stand with the people and victims. Ali Bongo has already had to cancel a state visit to the US in April because of this publicity. OpGabon has concentrated on ritual killings but that does not mean Anonymous is unaware of the corruption and profligacy of the Bongo regime. We are willing to expand our interest in the Bongo regime to include financial transparency if we feel it becomes necessary.</p>
<p>We won’t rest until legal action is taken against ritual killings of children in Gabon. We demand that criminals and their sponsors be prosecuted, including powerful blood suckers and heart eaters who are also politicians.</p>
<p>Please join us urgently to demand justice and an end to the impunity enjoyed by those who commit and order these horrors:</p>
<p>1) May 11 is the anniversary of the death of Bob Marley. In his honour, and in honour of the victims of ritual killings the people of Gabon will Get Up, Stand UP against ritual crimes. Activists are supported by local young and engaged musical artists like Meyaa Staff, ENCHA&#8217;A, Don Fiesta, Keurtyce E. and Mama Senateur.</p>

<h2>STATEMENTS FROM ALCR, GABONENERVANT AND OTHERS</h2>
<p>ALCR: &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Gabon" rel="nofollow">#Gabon</a> becomes the kingdom of abominations: crime, desecration of graves, disappearances, cannibalism and witchcraft.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>13 ritual killings in Gabon from January 1 to March 6 2013, all unpunished. &#8220;We must break the silence, and then talk everywhere!&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn’t Ali Bongo realize one can no longer keep ugly secrets closed, sooner or later, the truth always explodes for all to see?&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a>:&#8221;must not accept is normal for powerful people have young murdered, use parts of bodies for nonsensical ceremonies of witchcraft.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a>: &#8220;Educated Gabonese are too ashamed to talk about it because they think that this makes Gabon look bad in the eyes of foreigners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Gabon" rel="nofollow">#Gabon</a> activists who speak against ritual crimes are in danger of their lives and have no support from media, law or government. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a> &#8220;may implement mob justice, if government cannot protect children, parents have to do whatever necessary to keep children alive.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a> (&#038; elsewhere) are facing escalating crisis of ritual killings that have no basis in tradition and are market driven by powerful.</p>
<p>Compare media coverage on Gabon ritual killings to media coverage of Gabon ivory poaching. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>Once more, these ritual killings are NOT traditional in Gabon, they are new and escalating, market driven by psychopaths in power. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>You know it&#8217;s not a real democracy when politicians eat their citizens to bring election luck. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>People are placed on train tracks, river banks, in fires and hospitals to disguise ritual killings. But organs are missing. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
<p>What if your country was taken over by a cult that ate the citizens &#038; bathed in their blood &#038; for 4 decades the world ignored it? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOSGabon" rel="nofollow">#SOSGabon</a></p>
