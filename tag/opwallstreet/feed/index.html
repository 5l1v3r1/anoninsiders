				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a call to all Anonymous “members” and citizens of the world.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the DoJ and other government entities such as the SEC think that it is more important for them to regulate freedom of speech and information rather than to regulate the blatant organized crimes of the financial market.  They persecute people like us, Occupy, and Arron Swartz instead of the Bankers and Wall Street executives and CEOs who have robbed Americans of their hard earned tax dollars.  </p>
<p>They hand out billions upon billions of dollars to people who in no way need it yet our conditions for the poor, or even the middle class, have been continually diminishing.  The middle class is now almost non existent thanks to the crimes of Goldman Sachs and other firms who have indulged in sinister and criminal practices.</p>
<p>Thousands of innocent and exploited people are being forced into homelessness while these same CEOs and executives make billions in so called profit.  They make their fortunes on the shattered lives and broken dreams of people who were nothing more than slightly ignorant when trying to establish a comfortable life for themselves and their family.</p>
<p>It is no longer tolerable that these men and women get to live in luxury and lawlessness while innocent people are pushed into poverty and people who fight for freedom are prosecuted and demonized.</p>
<p>They demonize Occupy, they demonize Anonymous, they demonized Arron Swartz, they demonized Julian Asnage and Bradley Manning.  They demonize the very people they force onto the street by calling them incompetent and lazy while calling themselves successful.</p>
<p>They must be stopped.  With the recent pathetic assault on Anonymous’ methods by the Bank of America, with the growing despondence of the public.  OPERATION WALL STREET, must be launched.</p>
<p>Although the attack on the NYSE was coordinated and acted on, more must be done now! It should be the duty of any Anonymous, any hacker, in solidarity with Occupy, to release the Dox on the CEOs &#038; any and all Executives of Goldman Sachs, AIG, Wells Fargo, Chase, Meryl Lynch, and any other guilty party.  Their dox, any and all possible personal information on these people, must be released and made public and spread across the internet as much as possible.  The people who have lost their homes and had their lives destroyed deserve to know who it was that did it.</p>
<p>We can no longer let these disgraceful human beings live in luxury and escape the consequences of their actions.  People are angry and rightfully so.  We are stuck more and more in a state which we can not get out of and which is not our fault.  The guilty must pay.  OPERATION WALL STREET HAS BEEN PROPOSED, LAID OUT, AND LAUNCHED.  We promise not to hurt you once we release your information but we cannot hold the people you screwed over responsible for their actions once they know who you are and where you live.  You are not free to escape the consequences of your actions, no one is.  </p>
<p>We are Anonymous, We are Legion, We do not Forgive, We do not Forget.</p>
<p>Expect Us.</p>
