				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings. We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>On October 11, 2013 Anonymous informed the local and national media of our involvement in the case of Savannah Cross, age 2, raped and murdered in the Phoenix, Arizona area. As of this writing her killers remain free due to the inefficiency of the Maricopa County Medical Examiner&#8217;s office and her equally culpable mother continues to provide medical &#8220;care&#8221; for our Nation&#8217;s veterans due to the uncaring bureaucracy of the Phoenix VA Hospital.</p>
<p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>To the media of Maricopa County, the state of Arizona, the United States, and the world, you can not continue to ignore this. This is a child in your community, a child in your city, a child in our country. If you don&#8217;t stand up for her, then who will? If not now, then when? There is nothing more important than seeking justice for an abused and murdered child. Step up to the plate and bring this horrendous story the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Anonymous reiterates our demand that the Maricopa County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office stop playing budget politics with this case and get your job done so the County Attorney can re-file charges forthwith. You have had more than enough time. If the lab is the problem, then get on the telephone and fix the problem. Your seeming ineptitude is criminal in its own right.</p>
<p>Phoenix VA Hospital, you have had more than enough time to remove Ashley Dattoli Livengood from your employ. Indeed, she is not even a full-time employee and Arizona is a &#8220;right to work&#8221; state. You need prove no misconduct to terminate her employment. Our Nation&#8217;s veterans deserve far better than to be &#8220;cared&#8221; for by this uncaring monster who reportedly told co-workers she would &#8220;see her when I see her&#8221; regarding Savannah. At this time you have 7 days to terminate her employment or we will begin directly contacting veteran&#8217;s and military groups in your area. If you want protests on your campus, continue to ignore this demand. We will not ask again.</p>
<p>Anonymous wishes to again state that we fully support the actions of the Maricopa County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, Phoenix Police Homicide Division, all first responders, and the Maricopa County Attorney&#8217;s office in this case. We thank you for doing your jobs. We again demand that others do theirs.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>OpJustice4Savannah continues to be engaged.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2012, Savannah Cross, 2, of Phoenix Arizona,was brutally abused for the last time and died because of the direct abuse and neglect of at least three individuals who must be held fully accountable. Formally accused in this matter were Ryan Reed and Allison Clement. Not accused, but equally culpable in the eyes of Anonymous, is Savannah&#8217;s mother Ashley Dattoli Livengood.</p>
<p>According to the Maricopa County Attorney, Ryan Reed beat or stomped this beautiful baby to death while his companion, Allison Clement, watched his repeated abuse and took no action. Reed has admitted this to police, guilt is not in doubt. In the eyes of civilized people across the World this is unforgivable. It should also be noted that the child had been left in their &#8220;care&#8221; for weeks on end by Ashley Livengood while she worked as a stripper and escort. Reed and Clement were promptly and properly arrested and were held in jail until September 23, 2013 when all charges were dropped.</p>
<p>Charges dropped? Indeed, charges were dropped due to Arizona &#8220;Rule 8&#8221; a law designed to ensure accused persons receive a speedy trial. They were dropped because the Maricopa County Medical Examiner had not completed vital testing and the autopsy report within the allotted time within the boundaries of Rule 8. In fact, they failed to submit evidence to the testing laboratory until just recently. Anonymous rejects the fact that the County Attorney must adhere to Rule 8 while the Medical Examiner is under no obligation to do so.</p>
<p>Anonymous and the Cross family wish to thank the Maricopa County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, Phoenix Police Homicide Division, all first responders, and the Maricopa County Attorney&#8217;s office for a job well done. We stand fully in support of each of you. Our opinion of the Medical Examiner&#8217;s office differs slightly.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office; you now have our attention. It is clear that you have sat on this case in order to try and boost your budget. Anonymous, the people of Arizona, and the people of the World reject this tactic. It is on you to ensure that this evidence is now processed promptly and correctly so that these monsters may be recharged. Put simply, do your job. We are watching you. Fail and you may expect us.</p>
<p>Anonymous has learned that Savannah&#8217;s mother, Ashley Dattoli Livengood, is now employed by the Veterans Administration Hospital in Phoenix. Anonymous rejects this as suitable employment for Ms. Livengood. It is our collective opinion that this individual, regardless of licensing, is unfit to care for our veterans or for anyone else. We hereby demand her discharge, effective immediately.</p>
<p>All be advised that Anonymous is watching this case very closely. We demand justice for Savannah Cross.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
