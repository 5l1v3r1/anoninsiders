				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings world, we are Anonymous, and we are outraged.</p>
<p>This week, three guys who raped a girl with a wine bottle until she got internal injuries, was acquitted by the Swedish court. However, these guys were not acquitted by Anonymous. We are therefore callling upon the Anonymous collective to help us carry through with this operation.</p>
<p>The following text is from an article about the case:</p>
<p>&#8220;The prosecution recounted how the woman attended a party in Umeå, northern Sweden, in October last year where she met three 19-year-old men. She was acquainted with one of them. The charges said the men had taken her to a bedroom, where one had asked for oral sex while another exited the room only to return with an empty wine bottle. The Aftonbladet newspaper reported that the teen held the bottle up and said &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we use this&#8221;, before the men pinned her down on the bed and pried her legs open before inserting the wine bottle into her vagina. The men reportedly ended their actions when the girl started bleeding. One of the men allegedly told her not to report the incident to the police, which she nonetheless did. &#8221;</p>
<p>Since Anonymous as a collective firmly believes in human rights, meaning that every person have the right to their own bodies, we will never accept these kind of sexual abuse. For too many years now, people have stood by and watched while similar things happens, but Anonymous will no longer stand by and watch &#8211; we will act. And we have therefore decided to launch this operation, called <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpUmea" rel="nofollow">#OpUmea</a>, in which we will keep fighting this case until justice prevails. However, true justice cannot be brought in this case, because this girl will have to live with the memories of being forced to sex and abused by a wine bottle, even though she said no. The least we can do, is to show the rapists and the swedish court that no means no.</p>
<p>What will we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We will encourage the girl to appeal the verdict and support her in her choice of doing so.</li>
<li>We will show the world that even if the corrupt court accept these kind of sexual harassments, Anonymous <strong>do not</strong>.</li>
<li>We will expose the rapists by publishing there name in the d0x that is embedded in this press release.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can you do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread this press release.</li>
<li>Contact your local newspaper with this story and ask them to write about it.</li>
<li>Help Anonymous spread flyers about this case on the streets.</li>
<li>Get involved in the debate about this online, and don&#8217;t forget to use the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpUmea" rel="nofollow">#OpUmea</a> when you tweet about it.</li>
<li>That these three guys gets cleared by the court is a sign that is wrong with our society &#8211; so get involved in politics or a social movement that fights for human rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal with this operation is to get the girl to appeal the verdict and to get the three rapists punished for their crimes. Please note that we want these guys to be punished legally through a verdict against them in the swedish court. This operation does not include or encourage any illegal activites. So please DO NOT DDoS any site, order pizza, or visit the guys&#8217; houses. Let&#8217;s do this the honest way.</p>
