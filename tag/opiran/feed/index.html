<p>Most respectable and honorable citizens of Iran,</p>
<p>YOU ARE SPEAKING OUT &#8211; AND WE ARE LISTENING</p>
<p>YOU are Legion, and we expect you. The protesters who are imprisoned and beaten; the bloggers who are censored; the citizens who are executed for speaking against the regime: you are the ones truly loyal to your country. To those that would remain intimidated into subdued silence: You have passively enabled your government to make a mockery of your freedom. Now is your chance for action, for redemption, and representation. A new dawn is approaching, that will set you and your great country free from the shackles of oppression, tyranny and torture. It will let you exhale, and finally take the first breath that will fill your lungs with strength, wisdom and freedom. Anonymous; You, Me, Everybody, and Nobody. Together we can nullify any threat to our human rights, and they know it. They are aware of our existence, and the coming cascade, but know that they are powerless. As we have been forced to fear them, now they will learn to fear the Power of the People.</p>
<p>Most of all, they fear you; Which is why they have kept you in shackles for so long.</p>
<p>This is your time, you can now seize it and pave the way for your own future. The government of Iran deliberately portrays dissent as disloyalty, unjustly making &#8220;examples&#8221; out of those who speak against sanctioned actions. This strategy only works if people are intimidated into inaction. The government needs to be held accountable for its crimes against you, its citizens. You were the victim, but now you are the judge. Make your ruling.</p>
<p>People of Iran, you will not be denied your right to free speech and free press; your right to freedom of assembly, uncensored information and unlimited access to the Internet; your right to a life without oppression and fear.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Expect us.</p>

<p>To our Brothers and Sisters in Iran,</p>
<p>The noble people of Iran face many challenges. The greatest challenge to Iran is not the West or Israel. Like all people across the world, the greatest threat to Iran comes from the inside.</p>
<p>Since 1357 Iran has fought to rid itself of the sickness of dictators and wretched men. And now, a man who was not elected orders the execution of Iran’s political prisoners, teachers, journalists and students. A simple man cannot command the state. A man who is not elected is not president. Who is said to be the man who kills his brother? That man is a murderer.</p>
<p>This is not the country our ancestors worked to build. This is not what Iran – the country where Cyrus the Great wrote the first Human Rights Charter ever – deserves. In Iran and across the world, the people have returned to the streets to take back their freedom.</p>
<p>As people all over the world face their elections and challenges this year, together we will return the world to the people. A righteous world where all citizens live in freedom and security. People of Iran – we stand with you – no matter how long the road, or what the cost.</p>
