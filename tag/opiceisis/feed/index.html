<p>Many individuals have showed an amazing amount of support in regards to Operation ISIS and have asked how they can contribute to our cause. The steps below can be used to track Islamic State Twitter accounts and their websites.</p>
<p><strong>Locating an Islamic State Twitter account</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to this locating an Islamic State militant account can prove to be difficult however after locating your first account you will be able to find thousands more following these steps. ISIS militants and their supporters feed off of attention and publicity commonly using Twitter hash tags such as <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IslamicState" rel="nofollow">#IslamicState</a> among others. Run a Twitter search using this hash tag and you will find your first Islamic State account. If you are still having difficulty locating an account Twitter search <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CtrlSec" rel="nofollow">#CtrlSec</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpISIS" rel="nofollow">#OpISIS</a> </p>
<p><strong>I have located my first Islamic State Twitter account</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have located your first Islamic State Twitter account you will now be able to collect many more and form a vast network of information. With the account you initially located review all of their following and followers collecting Twitter account names as you move forward. When you are collecting account names you must retrieve their Twitter ID by visiting http://gettwitterid.com If you do not collect the account ID they can easily change their account name to evade you as they commonly do once detected. As you are collecting Islamic State Twitter accounts check each bio and their tweets for website URLS and log the information. With the data you have compiled visit http://pastebin.com and publish a paste of your findings. </p>
<p><strong>I have a list of Islamic State Twitter accounts and URLS</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have collected this information you can take action against them by reporting them to Anonymous, authorities and Twitter. If your paste link contains Islamic State Twitter accounts you can tweet your paste making sure to use the hash tag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CtrlSec" rel="nofollow">#CtrlSec</a> so the corresponding operatives can collect your link and terminate the accounts. If your paste link contains Islamic State website URLS tweet them using the hash tag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GhostSec" rel="nofollow">#GhostSec</a> so their operatives can collect intelligence and disable the websites. If you have concerns for your personal safety you can alternatively email us with your information at ghostsec@riseup.net using a anonymous mailer service such as http://anonymousemail.me </p>
