				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, citizens of the world and followers of Anonymous. In a modern day society of despotic surveillance, activism through digital means has become one of the most important ways we express ourselves as human beings dedicated to a cause. However, at the same time, there are thousands supporting the Anonymous movement without the slightest idea as to how to secure their digital identities and actions.</p>
<p>We are launching <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpEncrypted" rel="nofollow">#OpEncrypted</a> as an informational operation for the world. Not to target a specific group of individuals we have deemed an enemy of Anonymous, but rather to assist our allies with their own expression of beliefs. Anonymous, for years, has shown that as powerful as we are, we rely heavily on the ability to keep our guard up.</p>
<p>This operation will educate the masses on such technicalities as encryption, tunneling, proxying and obscuring an identity while operatives of the movement go about their business. Security is the most important thing in the arsenal of an internet activist. Together we will forever raise a wall against government snooping.</p>
<p>We have learned through the NSA revelations and the actions of our comrades within <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpNSA" rel="nofollow">#OpNSA</a> that government spying is here to stay. If we are to defeat our common oppressor, we must rise up as a collective and watch the backs of our fellow Anons.</p>
<p>Saddle up aboard our movement and travel safe.<br />
To get involved and learn how to be Anonymous, visit our IRC chat:<br />
webchat.anonops.com/?channels=#opencrypted</p>
<p>Or use your IRC client to join: irc.anonops.com/6697, channel: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpEncrypted" rel="nofollow">#OpEncrypted</a></p>
<p>We are Anonymous<br />
We are Legion<br />
We do not forgive<br />
We do not forget<br />
Expect us.</p>
