				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good day my friends.<br />
Close to half of the population at Guantanamo Bay are now hunger striking. It is time to stand in solidarity with them by demanding the Obama Administration to live up to it&#8217;s promises to shut the center down. <strong>Please take just a minute to sign a petition, send an email, and post a tweet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some relevant facts:</strong><br />
There are 166 detainees currently housed in Guantanamo Bay.<br />
86 have been approved for release.<br />
30 Yemenis are being &#8220;conditionally detained&#8221; because of an &#8220;unstable&#8221; homeland.<br />
46 are being detained indefinitely without trial.<br />
Some have been waiting more than 11 years for their release.</p>
<p>A compromise of sorts is proposed as a starting point. The goal is to pressure the Obama Administration on a domestic and international level to release those already approved. We will petition the American Government for release as well as Governments with citizens detained in Guantanamo to speak up. We will raise awareness of this issue with a Tweetstorm on Tuesday April 30th at 6:00 pm PST throughout the evening (worldwide trend it bros). Please take a moment to write letters to your own Governments, as well as governments with detained citizens.</p>

<p>Good Morning,<br />
The situation with Guantanamo Bay prisoners is ever worsening. Half of the 166 detainees are on hunger strike. Eighty-six of these men have already been approved for release; some have been waiting over ten years. These actions are in breach of NATO, the US Constitution, and general judicial decency. Many of these men are in poor health, some are near death, and need people to take immediate notice and advocate for their release.<br />
The goal is petition from citizens and pressure from international governments to immediately release the prisoners that they have approved for such. I feel that this is already long overdue, but a fair and plausible starting point.<br />
I am writing to request that you consider supporting my efforts by urging the Obama Administration to end the indefinite detention of prisoners deemed no longer a threat. I feel that enough attention to the matter may finally persuade the President to exercise his power to promptly discharge these men.<br />
I would appreciate any your help making this happen. I urge you to speak on the subject with your colleagues and let the US Congress know you support the campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quickly shortened version for the ones with a 1000 character limit:<br />

<h2>Finally</h2>
