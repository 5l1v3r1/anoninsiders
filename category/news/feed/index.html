				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time there were a bunch of people with varying skills that wanted to destroy the online presence of ISIS. Those people came together in a group called GhostSec (Ghost Security) in order to combine their various skills and cause more damage to ISIS.</p>
<p>Over the course of time that group changed, people left, people joined but the missions stayed largely the same. The group did some good in the world, took down some ISIS sites (more than 100( and had a bunch of twitter accounts banned (more than 15,000). The intel folks in the group even discovered attacks in Taxas, New York and Libya before they happened, in the time to let authorities know.</p>
<p>Unfortunately however, this lead various parts of the government to contact the group asking to leech off their intel. This was no problem, the group was happy to to share in the interests of keeping folds safe. But&#8230; Here our story turns nasty. The group had the idea to request funding for their intel and the government agreed (via a contractor of course), the intel then became a commodity that had to be protected and so stopped getting shared with the group&#8217;s followers. Divides started to appear in the group and many of the original members left.</p>
<p>New recruitment focused on intel folks instead of technical capability because intel is what earned them the bucks. Pretty soon all but 2 of the original members had left, taking with them all the technical skills and leaving behind guys who wanted to work as intel gathering engines for the government.</p>
<p>However, the folks left behind decided that as they did not control the ghostsec.org website domain and since their government paymaster did not like their historic link to Anonymous, it was better to form a new group, and they called this group GhostSecGroup (just think of the creative process that went into creating this name&#8230; mind blown). Some of the old members who left GhostSec, upon hearing the news that the others were leaving, decided to come back and reform the old GhostSec and fulfil the original goals of the group, for no money!</p>
<p>So, now we have GhostSecGroup, an intel organization with the government ties and GhostSec, the original Ghost Security everyone followed still executing on it&#8217;s original mission.</p>

<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
Our ships sail in support of the people of Greece who voted “No”<br />
to the EU and IMF&#8217;s hold on their financial affairs. The illusion machines, these devices of fraud society so desperately relies upon to keep worldwide greed flowing, they&#8217;re the ones responsible for the financial chaos you see before you. Chaos is good, it reveals truth.</p>
<p>240 Billion Euros were lent to Greece, of which 90% went to the banks that gave Greece funds before the crash. Less than 10% of that bailout money was left to be used by the Government for the economy and helping weaker members of Greek society. As always, the poor and struggling suffer because of the actions of an “elite” few. This time, we do not point our fingers to the government of Greece, because they are trying their best to protect their people – we point to the banks and fraudulent anti-human institutions who have plundered and raped a country rich of heritage and intellectuals stemming from the dawn of human civilization.</p>
<p>To the people of Greece, help us help you. We know you need food, we know you are suffering. We need information on food stores, food banks and how to get donations to proper non-government related entities. As long as the Greek government continues to protect it&#8217;s people from the greed of the banking elite, it will have nothing to fear from Anonymous.</p>
<p>We Salute you Greece, for saying “όχι”</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
Είμαστε ανώνυμοι<br />
Expect us.<br />

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Greetings from the real world. You know, where cause and consequence reign free and mighty.  I&#8217;ll send you a postcard sometime. Anyway&#8230; How is being a human bidet for the FBI treating you? The very people you taught the young and impressionable to hate.  I heard you now have a job as a security consultant? That sounds fun. Life is looking pretty cosy for you currently. Hey, talking of cosy; It&#8217;s Jeremy Hammonds birthday soon, January the 8th. I was considering sending him book or something because, from experience, jail isn&#8217;t too cosy and he could do with things to do to pass the time. After all, 10 years is a hell of a stint for jail, paedophiles and rapists get less. </p>
<p>Do you remember Jeremy at all? He&#8217;s one of the people you set up and sold out to save yourself. But enough about Jeremy, let&#8217;s talk about you Hector. I can tell you love talking about good old Sabu lately after all. </p>
<p>I must admit that after the initial sting at the realisation of what you did over our time spent communicating, I haven&#8217;t thought about you much. I feel a strong sense of injustice over what happened and the way things went, but as a general rule it&#8217;s a case of &#8216;out of sight, out of mind&#8217;.  But then you started popping up on my time line &#8211; &#8216;Sabu has attended VICE as a VIP.&#8217; &#8216; Sabu is doing an interview for CBS news.&#8217; &#8216;Sabu speaks about his days of hacking for CNET.&#8217;  You get the point. </p>
<p>So I watch, and I have to be honest, even though you did what you did I was still kind of half expecting a show of remorse or even an acceptance for what you did. Something, anything. But it was like wishing from blood from a stone. You tried to rationalise what you did and you outright lied. You flaunt yourself on TV making yourself out to be some kind of modern day hero, asking who will guard the guards and various other bullshit. Let&#8217;s not forget Hector, we had to endure your bullshit for a long time and we know exactly what you are. </p>
<p>Remember the time Jake and Mustafa wanted to walk away? You knew Jake was young as you had spoken to him numerous times via voice chat. It was too much and they didn&#8217;t want to be a part of it any more. But Big-Bad Sabu came out and you raged at them in IRC. I asked you to back off them but you wouldn&#8217;t, and so Jake and Mustafa stayed around longer than they wanted and got deeper than they had ever intended. You actively pulled children back into a world of crime to continue something they didn&#8217;t even want to do. You are a bully and a criminal and the only person who was caught who hasn&#8217;t paid a sufficient price for what you did. You were the worst of all of us. The knowledge  you lacked in technical ability you made up for in manipulation and a big loud mouth with the ability to coax people into doing things. Using your online persona and charismatic ways to adjust peoples view on things to what you were trying to spin at the time. Pure peer pressure. Nobody, especially the children you dragged in, could say no to you or you would attempt to scare them. </p>
<p>You were caught but instead of taking responsibility, you bent over and let the FBI take turns at riding you out. &#8220;Mastermind&#8221; (I laugh every time.) you are not, but a manipulating conductor of targets and (admittedly) persuasive and entirely convincing social engineer you are.<br />
Jeremy and I were mostly happy exploring and reporting exploits if you remember correctly. Sure, we had some lulz along the way, but who&#8217;s idea was it to go for big targets for pure self gain? Credit cards, the dumping of personal information, ruining of lives. This was all on the Great Sabu. Is this what masterminding a group is? Just telling people to be bigger shits than they need to be on the Internet but doing non of it himself? Backing people into corners and claiming you had a hand in any of it other than setting people up to do your dirty work.<br />
The only thing you masterminded was your own freedom by coercing and manipulating Jeremy and I into doing things you couldn&#8217;t do. You manufactured these scenarios and targets to make us look like bigger threats than we ever were or would have been without your constant pushing. Yes, we were able to do these things, but we had no intention of doing so without you orchestrating a few targets and spinning some crap reasons of why. Constantly giving us speeches of why we should do these things and using our weakness of wanting to spread concerns about security against us. You wanted us to flex our abilities in front of you so you could log it and go crying back to the FBI in order for them to fear us more than they feared you; you turned what we were doing into something much more sinister so that they thought that apprehending us was more in their interests than putting you in jail. All so you could go back home and take selfies of yourself for the media.</p>
<p>If the authorities have anything to fear, it isn&#8217;t our skills (although, people should fix their shit. Seriously. For every ones sake.) it&#8217;s people like you who run their mouth and rile the impressionable up to a point of anger, using your charismatic way of exciting people into a false sense of revolution. Whilst all you care about is yourself and your ulterior motives. We were interested in the way things work and our want and our need to learn and penetrate so-called secure systems clouded our judgement of your real intentions. I take full responsibility for what I have done. I&#8217;ve served my time in jail, I was tagged, I&#8217;m on probation, I have restrictions that hinder my general progress towards a career but I have accepted the punishment &#8211; so if you think that this is me trying to offshoot any blame, then don&#8217;t. I know what I&#8217;ve done. I actually feel most shame for some of the things I said to people along the way and lives I effected more than anything. But you have taken exactly ZERO responsibility for any of this. </p>
<p>So who are you Hector? &#8216;Legendary hacker&#8217; ? &#8216;leader of anonymous and Lulzsec&#8217; ? You would have functioned better as a cult leader. Pushing, pressuring and preying on younger and smarter people than yourself and running them into the ground. If all you did was relay information for the FBI and steal credit card details (which you didn&#8217;t even do. You got us to do it for you.) then what is your purpose anyway? Since most of the words you spun us were under influence of the FBI you couldn&#8217;t have meant any of it considering you were just trying to get us to do things to report. You don&#8217;t care about movements or activism or rights, because you try sell out anybody who does. You know a few good tricks but as a general rule your hacking know-how is quite limited. So who are you Hector Xavier Monsegur and why are you on TV? Because I spent quite a while getting to know you, and all I see is a coward and a fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would stay away from anonymous&#8221; says ANONYMOUSabu who riled up thousands to hate authorities and even tried to incite violence towards them. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was too much publicity&#8221; says the person whose main focus was to talk shit on twitter. </p>
<p>&#8220;They knew my weakness was my kids&#8221; says the man who I continuously warned to back away from all of this and never come back, for your kids sake. I tried to protect those kids way before you even tried to use them as a reason for saving yourself and betraying your friends. I wouldn&#8217;t blame you for choosing your children over your friends if it saved them from going into the system, any sane person would &#8211; but I do blame you for putting crime before your children in the first place. It should have never come down to that decision to begin with and you know I told you this countless times. Spinning your kids as a reason for being a coward is idiotic and false and makes you look desperate to try rationalise what you did.</p>
<p>&#8216;helped intercept attacks and share them with the government&#8217; &#8211; attacks that YOU initially thought up, so you didn&#8217;t prevent anything, you just suggested something and when we spoke about it you relayed what information we gathered and you put an end to it and avoided nearly 30 years in prison? Wow. You certainly are an American hero, a (what was it you said?) &#8220;inspiration&#8221; to people. I, for one, can&#8217;t wait to teach my children to set my friends up and help the FBI entrap. A true role model to all. </p>
<p>&#8220;it wasn&#8217;t a situation where I identified anybody. I didn&#8217;t point my fingers at anybody.&#8221; &#8211;  I&#8217;ll let the FBI handle this one:<br />
&#8220;monsegur also provided crucial and detailed information about the formation, organisation, hierarchy and membership of these hacking groups, as well as specific information about their planning and execution of many major cyber attacks, including the specific roles of his co-conspirators in committing those crimes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Monsegur assists law enforcement in identifying and locating lulzsec members and affiliates. In addition to this crucial historical information, Monsegur proactively cooperated with ongoing Government investigations. Working sometimes literally around the clock, at the direction of the law enforcement. Monsegur engages his co-conspirators in online chats and were critical to confirming their identities and whereabouts.&#8221;<br />
So the FBI were wrong? In that case surely you can go join Jeremy in jail as because snitching on your &#8216;brothers&#8217; is the only reason you&#8217;re at home eating doughnuts right now.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t babble on any more because but I will ask you, respectfully, to stop talking so much shit and own up to something (preferably something that you actually did and not somebody else. Claiming responsibility to make yourself looked more skilled than you are is just strange Hector.) You&#8217;re on TV giggling like a little school girl about how you used to hack free AOL Internet as a child as Jeremys talent rots away in jail by your hand.</p>
<p>Oh, before I forget and obviously completely unrelated &#8211; what is the legal age of sexual consent over there? 18? How old did you think I was? 16? You weren&#8217;t the only one who kept logs Hector.<br />
Be a decent human for once in your life and find that hole to crawl back into instead of rubbing what you did in peoples faces.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully,<br />
Your &#8220;brother&#8221; Ryan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="620" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZxUn80p7VgU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In December, we caught Chicago Police illegally snooping on Black Lives Matter organizers with a Stingray. Now, we turn our attention to Toronto where we once again have recorded proof that Toronto Police spy on activists&#8217; cell phones. Once again, a particular, very high ranking officer can be named. </p>
<p>A recording by independent journalist Kenneth Lipp at a conference of Police Chiefs in Philadelphia in 2013 has Chief Bill Blair bragging about how Toronto Police spies on activists in precisely this kind of way. Blair describes spying and attempting to control a Palestinian demonstration at the same time a celebration was happening for Toronto&#8217;s 2012 Canadian Football League championship win.</p>
<p>Chief Blair: “Social media was being monitored within the command centre by some of our [???] people . And they came to us and said, &#8216;there&#8217;s something going on here.&#8217;  And well they were using a thing called geofencing to determine the location of where these discussions were taking place and who was involved in the discussion. And they determined that 100s of people were now merging on a particular area for the demonstration, which was then morphing into what was going to become a protest and a march, that would have interfered with the sports celebration that was taking place.”</p>
<p>Chief Blair: “But we were very fortunate because there was also an individual in that demonstration who was the primary organizer. But he was using social media very effectively to organize that demonstration. He was sending out tweets. He was giving his location. He had not turned off geofencing capability of his own device. So we were able to monitor his location and confirm it&#8217;s truthfulness. But he was also uploading in real time, videos of the crowd as it gathered, and messaging that he was sharing with his other organizers for this event. He&#8217;d in fact, became our very best intelligence officer on the scene. He was organizing the event, but he was the best informer to what was going on.” *</p>
<p>On November fifth, 2014, 200 Anons in Toronto joined the global Million Mask March. Around 9pm, with just a handful of Anons left at Queen&#8217;s Park, one of our most reliable Anons heard Toronto Police say into a phone or radio, we cannot do anything with it, his phone&#8217;s geo location data is switched off. We recently obtained that evening&#8217;s Toronto Police dispatch tapes. They confirm that Toronto Police were targeting organizers&#8217; cell phones.<br />
Female Dispatcher: “I can try getting her cell phone trace, if you need it. In the meantime [??put in a mother..?” <~~LOLWUT

Less than two minutes later, one of the same voices comes back on the air: 
Female Voice “And 5135 getting an update saying that the male is on his cell.”
“Yeah[completely unintelligible] 2103.” (or 9:03pm)

Again, within a few minutes, the dispatch tapes prove it's our Million Mask March demo, they are monitoring:  
Male Officer: “I have a group of about 20 left at Queens Park. [We're leaving em here] in the hands of Queen's Park security.”	


There's also this lovely bit from earlier in the evening when we marched down to the Eaton Centre:
FEMALE Dispatch: “Is it the one from the text or is it a different one?”
MALE Officer: “That number is 416-93[redacted by Anonymous]
FEMALE Dispatch: “Do you know who the provider is?” 
MALE Officer: “Well, let me see what I can find out. Uh, PC van [____ ?? Sabilia?] on the air”

 In 2013, Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner made it very clear that police use of surreptitious geo locational monitoring requires a specific judicial warrant according to the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in R versus Wise. Chief Blair also discusses spying on lawyers earlier in his Toronto Policing career. 
Chief Blair: “Back in the early eighties, I was working organized crime. And I remember when video cameras first became readily available, and affordable, to the police. I put cameras up everywhere. I had cameras in lawyers' offices. I put them in interview rooms at the jail.

As Chief Blair continues to refuse to answer for his actions at the G 20 five years ago, both the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada are courting him for a chance to run for a place in federal parliament.  It is well beyond disturbing that Justin Trudeau thinks it okay to include in his caucus a man who trammels the rights of activists and lawyers. This is not to mention that Blair presided over a racist stop and frisk program, a program documented to be even worse for black people in Toronto than New York City's stop and frisk program was for African Americans. Let us be completely clear, if Chief Blair is made one of their federal candidates, the Liberal Party of Canada, like the Toronto Police already, should very much: 

EXPECT Us!

*[Blair continues: “And he shared his planning with those who he was trying to attract to his demonstration, but he was also sharing it with us. And his information that he provided to us was the best intelligence that we were receiving about that demonstration on that day. And it enabled us to determine the number of people we would send to that, the response that we would be able to provide, and it also created a [ ] for us to communicate with him and his followers about our expectations about their behaviour [  coughing ]. And it changed the whole nature of it, quite frankly; it made it a manageable event. What we have also seen in other large demonstrations is that type of analysis can be tremendously important.”]

<p><strong>3. VPN programları</strong></p>
<p>VPN nedir?<br />
Virtual Private Network (Sanal Özel Ağ) teriminin kısaltılmışı olan VPN, basit bir anlatımla internet üzerinde kurulu bilgisayarlar grubundan oluşur. Bu özel bilgisayar ağı, örneğin yerel bir ağa fiziksel erişimi bulunmayan, dışarıdaki bir kişi tarafından ağ kaynaklarına erişmekte kullanılabilir. VPN’ler, güvenilmeyen ağlara bağlanırken bağlantıyı şifrelemek ve güvenli hale getirmek için de kullanılır. Bunun yanında VPN’ler, farklı konumlarda bulunabildiğinden, sizi ülkelerin kısıtlamalarından (yasaklı web siteleri ve IP’ler gibi) da kurtarırlar.<br />
VPN’lerle bağlantınız şifreli olduğundan, gönderdiğiniz ve aldığınız tüm veriler şifrelendiğinden, meraklı gözler ne yaptığınızı göremezler.<br />
VPN’i sadece engelli sitelere erişim sağlayabilmeniz için anlatıyoruz. Bazı VPN şirketleri mahkeme kararlarına uyup istendiği takdirde bilgilerinizi otoritelere verebilirler, bundan dolayı internette ne yaptığınıza dikkat edin.</p>

<p><strong>6.1 Windows 7.x ve 8.x işletim sisteminde DNS değiştirme:</strong></p>
<p>Ağ ve network Merkezinde sağ alt köşesinde olan WiFi sembolüne basın =&gt; Bağlantılar: &lt;senin bağlı olduğun WiFi network isimi&gt; (tıkla) =&gt; Özellikler =&gt; Internet Protokol sürüm 4 (TCP/IPv4) =&gt; Özellikler =&gt; Aşadaki DNS sunucu adreslerini kullan: (işaretle)</p>
<p>”<em>Terceh edilen DNS sunucusu:</em>&#8221;  &#8220;<em>208 . 67 . 222 . 222</em>&#8221; ekle<br />
“<em>Diger DNS sunucusu:</em>“ ”<em>208 . 67 . 222 . 220</em>” ekle</p>
<p><strong>“<em>Diğer DNS sunucusu:</em>” boş bırakabilirsiniz.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IPv6 adresleri kullanmak için ”Internet Protokol sürüm 4 (TCP/IPv4)” yerine ”Internet Protokol sürüm 4 (TCP/IPv6)”“ seç ve aynı şekilde devam et.</strong><br />
<strong>Modemi veya bağlantıyı kesmek ve yine kurmak bağlantı problemini çözebilir. DNS bağlantısını Windows 8.x altında değiştirmek için sağ alt köşede olan WiFi sembolüne mousesa sağ padla tıkla ve aynı Windows 7.x olduğu gibi devam et.</strong> (Video olarak: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njAsz8MYwew">TIKLA</a>)</p>
