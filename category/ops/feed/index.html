<p>ISIS is small state that brutally censors visiting journalists and its own people. As such it must be opposed. The question is in what manner should it be opposed.</p>
<p>We think it&#8217;s great if people want to hack ISIS and publish their secrets. But engaging in social media censorship campaigns and dealing with intelligence contractors and government agents is deeply stupid. The former will contribute to legitimize the spread of internet censorship and will lead to the increased censorship for everyone, including Anonymous. Dealing with government agents et al will not only result in many more informers in Anonymous bu twill also damage its reputation as it will lead to a view that Anonymous is too close to US intelligence interests.</p>
<p>The same intelligence industry that runs their own NSA hacker operations against ISIS uses the same counter-terrorism justification to spy on everyday civilians with no regards for rights to privacy, encryption, or anonymity. They have always targeted Anonymous and other dissident groups as terrorists, and when they aren’t trying to discredit or imprison us, they are attempting to co-opt us – sometimes openly by attending conferences like DEFCON, seducing us with promises of money or calls for patriotic duty, other times covertly lurking around IRC channels attempting to steer us unwittingly into supporting their agenda.</p>
<p>We would like to strongly advise &#8211; while we cannot speak for the whole of Anonymous &#8211; to always release information to the public, as we want to operate in its interest. Any attempts to act in secrecy, supporting political or governmental organizations, will be discouraged by us or completely ignored to safeguard our allies and supporters fighting for openness and transparency within governments, dictatorships and organizations around the globe that control various aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>We are on the side of the oppressed, not the oppressors. We support the victims of war, not the war-makers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anonymous Operation Ferguson &#8211; Press Release: &#8220;Operation Take Down&#8221; Initiated</p>
<p>Tuesday &#8211; November 24, 2015  11:00 AM ET USA</p>
<p>The Anonymous team of Operation Ferguson watched with horror as a group of highly armed white supremacist terrorists opened fire on the Black Lives Matter protesters at the 4th Precinct occupation in Minneapolis, Minnesota &#8211; gravely injuring at least five innocent protesters. These men wore bullet proof vests, covered their faces &#8211; and had been watching the occupational protest at the 4th Precinct for days. This was a planned terrorist attack by organized white supremacists. And it&#8217;s not the first in recent memory, as earlier this year nine innocent black people were slain by a white supremacist gunman in their own church in South Carolina&#8230;.WHILE THEY PRAYED!</p>
<p>The MPLS police responded to the shooting of innocent protesters in front of their precinct house NOT by offering aid or assistance, but by further brutalizing them with mace and batons. And the MPLS police will answer to us for this crime at a time and by a method of our choosing. The white supremacist movement in the USA however is a different story. From this moment forward Anonymous declares itself to be at war with these domestic terrorists. We will hunt you down, expose you &#8211; and destroy your lives. We will remove your social media accounts and other online assets from the Internet. We will bring to bear against the white supremacists in the USA the same exact tools and tactics that have been so successfully deployed this past year by Anonymous against ISIS and other jihadists. If you are a white supremacist in the USA, your time is up &#8211; and your doom is upon you.</p>
<p>For this Operation we will consult with and use the same template as the Anons and other hacker crews in Op ISIS have utilized so effectively against terrorists already. We will begin with a &#8220;Report A Racist&#8221; feature on an Op Take Down page which will be available by the end of today on our main website &#8211; www.OperationFerguson.cf</p>
<p>We will join forces with our sister Op, Operation KKK. We will use the crowd sourced data we obtain through this process of reporting to investigate these individuals and assets, determine if they are indeed white supremacist related &#8211; and then target these individuals and assets through cyber attacks, public exposure &#8211; and the removal of their accounts from the Internet. We will especially expose police or political leaders who have any ties to white supremacy. We will find these animals, expose them &#8211; and destroy their lives. As we did in Op KKK, we will eventually provide our vetted data on all white supremacist organizations and individuals in the USA to the various domestic anti-hate group NGO&#8217;s who make it their business to monitor these terrorists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Operation Take Down&#8221; will be managed by the team of Anonymous Operation Ferguson. We encourage those who want to support or assist us in this fight against domestic terrorists, as well as interested journalists &#8211; to visit our website and follow our Twitter. Just as it does in Op ISIS, it will take all the effort of the entire Anonymous Global Collective to crush these terrorists. If you are an Anon or un-affiliated hacker, please join us.</p>
<p>This is war. We have long experience in destroying white supremacists in the USA. If you are a white supremacist it&#8217;s too late to expect us. We suggest you run as fast as you can, and hide. Because we will show you no mercy when we find you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where to Start? The basics. The Ku Klux Klan has approximately 150 active cells, operating in 41 states, with membership concentrated in both the South and the Midwest. The KKK is not what it once was but it does continue to survive in various locations throughout the United States. At its peak, membership was in the millions. Now, membership is likely less than 5,000. It is very important to understand &#8211; the KKK does not have a central unified leadership. Instead, they are split off into local cells or groups.</p>
<p>These groups generally oppose interracial relationships, homosexuality and illegal immigration and historically express this ideology through acts of terror. We want to remind you: This operation is not about the ideas of members of the Ku Klux Klan. This is about the behaviors of members of KKK splinter cells that bear the hallmarks of terrorism. When members of the KKK like Frazier Glenn Miller, (founder of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party) murdered three innocent individuals at a Jewish retirement home during Passover &#8211; the word &#8220;terrorism&#8221; was seldom found in mainstream media&#8217;s coverage of the attack. Why? What sort of violence does it take to call *some* factions of Ku Klux Klan what *some* of these cells really are? </p>
<p>We defend free thought and free speech. The anons responsible for this operation will not support *acts* of terrorism and *acts* of hate inflicted upon the public. The KKK is part of an important cultural landscape and history in the United States.<br />
We need to make room for important, blunt, honest, public, productive conversation. Violent bigotry IS a problem in the United States. This is not a colorblind society. It deeply divided on racial lines.</p>
<p>We hope Operation KKK will, in part, spark a bit of constructive dialogue about race, racism, racial terror and freedom of expression, across group lines. Public discourse about these topics can be honest, messy, snarky, offensive, humbling, infuriating, productive, and serious all at once. The reality is that racism usually does NOT wear a hood but it does permeate our culture on every level. Part of the reason we have taken the hoods off of these individuals is not because of their identities, but because of what their hoods symbolize to us in our broader society.</p>
<p>In media, the Ku Klux Klan is an easy target to pick on. In terms of the KKK, journalists usually print what they want with very little consequence because sensational stories like this generate impressive ad revenue (just like with the bogus OpKKK leak).<br />
We feel it is important to provide accurate information about our observations during this operation. We learned, that aside from our striking differences in overall ideology and behavior, we have found that many members of Ku Klux Klan groups actually have a few important similarities to us. For example, they are mostly poor and pissed off at the the Man. They oppose government surveillance and they generally feel persecuted for free thought. Day to day, some klan members work very hard for very little. This is a common ground we understand all to well. We feel that the ability to find common struggles with those that are very different than ourselves is important. Even if they are filled with hatred. We will never sympathize with the KKK but we do desire to understand them and learn about how they see their world. We do see their humanity, we respect their right to free thought and we know their fear of others is wrong. We also know their behaviors strike fear, anxiety and terror into others. This will no longer be socially tolerated.</p>
<p>In this dox list, you will find official members of various KKK groups throughout the United States as well as their closest associates (most are also in other extremist hate groups). You will see many names with ALIAS beside it. If indicated, these are CONFIRMED aliases. Other names on this list may be aliases, as well. Some aliases we were unable to crack. The klan sometimes hides behind several online identities. Given name or alias, these are the real people underneath the hoods.</p>
<p>It is important to note that many klan members change klan affiliations as well as go back and forth between being klan members and neo nazis etc (sometimes both, if permitted). There is quite a bit of movement between these types of groups (usually due to infighting). For this reason, you will see some names of individuals that are listed as neo nazis and so on. Some members of this list are quite dangerous, sociopathic individuals. Others are not.</p>
<p>Data collected for Operation KKK was gathered over approximately 11 months and those included on this list were identified primarily through HUMINT (human intelligence) data collection strategies. This means that individuals on this list were often identified by human sources of information through both overt (interviewing expert sources) and covert (digital espionage / social engineering) methods. Individuals on our list were also identified through open source intelligence strategies (OSINT). This is a broad array of information and sources that are generally available to the public. This includes: multimedia, academic records and public data. Members often told on themselves to us about their connections with the KKK during various chat conversations we had with klan members and affiliates throughout the course of our operation. You never know who you are talking to on the internet. </p>
<p>We understand this initiative is extremely controversial and we know we will face much criticism for this operation and our work will be heavily scrutinized. We hope this body of work speaks for itself. This is the OFFICIAL Operation KKK 2015 intel report associated with the <a href="https://twitter.com/Operation_KKK" rel="nofollow">&commat;Operation_KKK</a> Twitter account. The anons at <a href="https://twitter.com/Operation_KKK" rel="nofollow">&commat;Operation_KKK</a> are responsible for this specific liberation of information and we have done our best to ensure accuracy and avoid collateral damage to innocent parties. Erring on the side of caution, we removed several names from this list for further evaluation.</p>
<p>We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings citizens of the world, we are anonymous.</p>
<p>Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, it has come to our attention that you have decided to disregard your citizens, the people of this country, and have persisted to project an unique Gateway to the Internet, in running a system which only benefits yourselves and the giant corporate bodies operating.</p>
<p>We saw the situation in Thailand for the past months going too far, restricting basic access to freedom of speech, protests and basic human rights against anyone who criticized the Thai Junta.</p>
<p>The latest project of the Thai military government is to deploy a single gateway in order to control, intercept and arrest any persons not willing to follow the Junta orders and your so called moral.</p>
<p>No interception systems ever stopped any terrorist attacks, neither any national security threats in Asia or any western countries. It only allows greedy governments and large corporations to get more profits and less freedom of speech for the people of this country.</p>
<p>The land of smile will soon be similar to China, North Korea or any tyranic country providing intrusive electronic systems to spy and prosecute their own citizens having different ways of thinking.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable that you promote your own people, army executives at the Head of the largest Telecommunication operator: CAT Telecom. Any Corporations or individuals helping to deploy this single gateway will be targeted by any electronic means.</p>
<p>We will not only fight against the single gateway project but will expose your incompetence to the world, where depravity and  personal interests prevail. </p>
<p>More than 6,000 people died and 10,000 injured in south of Thailand you have no budget to end this daily terrorist genocide killing innocents, but find 15 million USD budget to censor your own citizens. Our Thai brothers will understand what ความไม่สงบในชายแดนภาคใต้ของประเทศไทย means.</p>
<p>Together we stand against the injustice of your Government, tomorrow you will pay the price of your oppression against your own people.</p>
<p>You can arrest us, but you can&#8217;t arrest an idea.</p>
<p>We are anonymous.<br />
We are Legion.<br />
United as ONE.<br />
Divided by zero.<br />
We do not forgive Censorship.<br />
We do not forget Oppression.<br />
Expect us.</p>

<p>Saturday &#8211; July 18, 2015 4:00 PM ET At approximately 6:30 PM PT on July 17, 2015 at an Anonymous protest in Dawson Creek, British Columbia which the RCMP was informed about in advance, an RCMP officer mercilessly shot and killed a masked Anon without provocation or cause. The situation should have been handled according to Treaty 8 protocols. And, if Canadian police were as brave as Canadian nurses, they could deal with people with knives without hiding behind bullets. This is the fourth Anon to be slain by security forces around the world in as many years. Turkey, Egypt, Palestine and now British Columbia in Canada. As in the past, Anonymous will not stand idly by while our own are cut down in mask. Anonymous has fought for the lives of protesters all over the globe, from Tahir Square in Egypt to Ferguson, Missouri. We will most certainly avenge one of our own when they are cut down in the streets while protesting the earth wrecking environmental policies of the Canadian government.</p>
<p>To this end Anonymous announces the launch of Operation Anon Down. The focus of this Op going forward will be gaining justice (and vengeance if necessary) for our fallen comrade in Dawson Creek. But we will also memorialize our previously slain brethren, and prepare to take action for future Anons killed by police &#8211; as we have no doubt they will cut down more of us.</p>
<p>To begin we will identify the RCMP officer involved, thoroughly dox him &#8211; and release that dox on the Internet. Because the world has a right to know every detail about killer cops. We will offer support and raise funds if necessary to cover the burial expenses of our fallen comrade. He will be buried with the honor and dignity that his courage has earned him. We will ensure that he is never forgotten, and takes his place in the growing ledger of brave Anonymous martyrs around the world. Then we will press the RCMP and Canadian government for justice. This RCMP officer must be named, fired, and charged &#8211; for the murder of our brother Anon. And if we do not receive justice, rest assured there will be revenge.</p>
<p>We call upon our fellow Anons in Canada to take to the streets and protest at the RCMP headquarters in every Province, every day &#8211; until our demands for justice are met. We call upon the Global Collective of Anonymous and allied crews to remove the RCMP cyber infrastructure from the Internet. March, create and sign petitions, hack, dox. We may not be able to bring back our fallen comrade, we may not even be able to prevent other Anons from being slain by murderous police &#8211; but we can sure as hell show them that there will be a steep price to pay when they kill us</p>
<p>&#8220;Behind this mask there is more than flesh and blood. Behind this mask is an idea. And ideas are bullet proof&#8221;</p>
<p>We Are Anonymous<br />
We Are Legion<br />
We Are Everywhere<br />
We Do Not Forgive<br />
We Do Not Forget<br />
To the murderous officers of the RCMP&#8230;it is to late to Expect Us</p>

<p>To the citizens of the United States,<br />
We Are Anonymous.</p>
<p>Our blood runs with rage for the murder of Sandra Bland and the subsequent coverup by Waller County Police and the Sheriff&#8217;s department. As a collective body, we are distraught and angered by the careless response of politicians and the pedaling of illegitimate and doctored evidence by the media.</p>
<p>In short, Sandra Bland was murdered and we are all furious.</p>
<p>It is time we take our anger to the streets. On August 8th, we rage against the corrupted system that killed Sandra Bland and continues to commit injustice across this country. We demand that Brian Encinia be arrested without delay and that each police chief in each protesting city re-attest their pledge to the crowd, to protect and serve their citizens. We also demand that all evidence and footage pertaining to Sandra Bland be handed over to the public. Dates, times, and appropriate locations have been posted in the description below. We will continue to protest every night until these demands are met.</p>
<p>To the Waller County Sherrif&#8217;s department, this is a message directed to you.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with our demands, we will answer with our wrath.</p>
<p>All your secrets will be leaked.</p>
<p>We all know where you live.</p>
<p>No mercy for murderers.<br />
We are Anonymous.</p>
<p>On August 8th, expect us.<br />

<p>The Anonymous collective is enraged at the failed attempt by Waller County PD and the Texas Trooper Association to mask a blatant act of crime against an innocent woman. And we will not stand as Sandra&#8217;s death becomes another hashtag and then a statistic.</p>
<p>We, Anonymous, are calling on the citizens of the United States to commit to a day of rage for Sandra Bland and all who have been murdered at the hands of ruthless law enforcement officials who know no honor. Cities around the United States will rise up in unison and call for Sandra Bland&#8217;s justice.</p>
<p>We, not as Anonymous but as citizens of the United States, are tired of the cycle of murders and coverups made by police departments across the nation. We demand that each police chief at each protesting city to come out to the crowds and renew their pledge to protect the people they serve. We also demand the immediate arrest of Brian Encinia and the resignation of both Waller County&#8217;s District Attorney and the Waller County&#8217;s Sheriff.</p>
<p>If you do not take Brian Encinia into custody, we will come after all of you. All your secrets will be leaked. You will all be vulnerable. We all know where you live.</p>
<p>This is for Sandra Bland. No mercy for murderers.</p>
<p>Operation Rage for Sandra, engaged.</p>
<p>We are Anonymous.<br />
We are legion.<br />
We do not forgive.<br />
We do not forget.<br />
Waller County law enforcement, it&#8217;s too late to expect us.</p>
